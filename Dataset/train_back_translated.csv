3714,"I think Matts has had his minutes of fame, note to the owners, your food is quite good, your staff is excellent, so please save your money and move to a better location right now, you are next to a run down hotel with police tape everywhere to appease the local residents who are seriously begging for any customers waiting outside your place, just sad, I won't be going there again, I won't recommend it either, good luck This summer, the heat will melt all the customers in your waiting room.",Bad
872,"on the way to the airport I decided to stop at Teds for a bite to eat since I live very close to this place and have never tried it before I thought it would be a great time to check this place out, it was good, nothing special inside and although I wasn't blown away by my experience here I really enjoyed myself, we waited in line and I ordered a giant beef hot dog with some Chili Austin got a sausage with some of the toppings and fries, we both liked it and plan to go back. soon pretty good",Good
4100,"the roads are good, the service is not that good, this place is a tourist trap in every sense of the word, the restaurant and gift shop are overpriced for what you get and the ice cream is nothing special, the staff service needs to be much better and treat the customers the way you want, always understaffed, always waiting for food, been there half a dozen times, no improvement comes to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs, a excellent road for motorbikes in summer, outdoor cooking.",Bad
8995,"I have known my way around Sky Harbor Airport since I was years old and the terminal was a real terminal since then their attempts to improve transportation, parking and the airport terminals have made it extremely confusing to take the wrong lane and end up in the parking lot when all you wanted to do was drop someone off at the departures curb. The terminal remains the most accessible with parking located across the street and few airlines parked there as only a few airlines now use this terminal. pizza and doesn't seem clean, the terminal is a bit more complicated although they have parking attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level via the elevator, more airlines use this terminal and it is much smaller than the terminal making it easier to navigate oh terminal you are so nice, new and clean, you have access to great restaurants like Flow Shanghai Café, Einstein's quizzes and more. at boarding you have tons of stores from border books to local tourist trash i would like to love you but you are just a mess it is very difficult to navigate your lanes to get to where you are going to pick up and drop off is dangerous because of people walking away from the curb into the lanes without looking and security is a pain not only is there always a long queue but the tea attendants regularly yell at people to be careful i am afraid to walk out of the terminal because that I have to leave very early because there are airports much easier to navigate and use, but we are stuck with Sky Harbor. I can only hope that the light rail access once completed will help make this a friendlier airport.",Bad
657,"I had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it, but once I walked in I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal had gone out the window, no offense to my hungry white friends, I decided to try it anyway. I was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot and sour soup which they were able to put in chicken instead of pork as a bonus and the waiter recommended the house chicken. spicy, look, damn, I'm brown people, that's my problem anyway, the hot and sour soup arrived and it was excellent. I was happy that nothing ruins a Chinese meal more than starting it with a bowl of hideous soup, then came the homemade chicken with added green beans for steamed rice costing another dollar. service, the waiter noticed that I was not devouring my dish and offered to replace it with any other dish of my choice at no extra cost. Who does this nowadays in a Chinese restaurant, no less extra stars are from the bay area like me, so he gave me information about good Asian food in Phoenix for dims, he recommended the Golden Buddha first, the Great Wall, second and third, then for Vietnamese he recommended a place on the avenue between the Indian school. Phoenix is ​​a bit of a letdown compared to California, but almost all Asian restaurants, he admitted, including China Chili, cater to their core customers who, by their demographics, are virtually non-Asian. He told me that China Chili is where people go for Chinese food, including Chris Bianca of Pizzeria Bianca, the mayor, the Channel News people, the owner of the Diamondbacks, and so take that for what you will when I asked if this Chinese chili was affiliated with the one in Fremont no but people say this place is good and classy and has an electric piano bonus points for knowing that either way he recommended I come back and get the mongolian beef next time which i will definitely do more the hot and sour soup i didn't mind the large open seating area many chinese restaurants are like that, loud and raucous, the chinese chili is a case where the service overcame the food again, how often does that happen to come back and give it another chance and there you go",Good
5439,"ok, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to go there. I was in town on business and thought I would give them a try. The food was good but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. that would be where the service was then, so maybe it was because I was in a group, whatever the reason it wasn't happening, hey at least the salsa was tasty",Good
2692,"the only thing this crispy cream place has to offer is a convenient location and passing by you won't see any donuts made here which is kind of part of what the crispy cream experience should be like seeing them being made ordering them as they come out so they are still warm for your first bite now so let's take this review as if it were a regular donut shop and it doesn't hold up either, the momandpop store that i have closer to me actually tastes better but that's probably because they make them then and there I guess they transport the ones they sell here from a different location or a centralized location where they make them which completely explains why the frostings and taste like they've been sitting for a while they're still ok donuts the other thing this place is lacking is in the coffee. I ordered a coffee and the person had one of those oversized half and half containers from clover farms and asked if I wanted some in my coffee and to tell him when to stop, I'm sorry but who puts anything on their coffee without even tasting it first, not me, it's definitely the worst experience having coffee here, bottom line the donuts here are not going to be what you expect from a crispy cream and forget ordering a coffee which will be to your taste",Bad
2204,"In a kitschy word, this pink palace serves a number of ice cream dishes, including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes, as well as build your own creations. The ice cream itself was disappointing. I was expecting a homemade recipe, but was a little surprised when I saw bins of dryers being brought into the front dining room given that it's located in Old Town Scottsdale, a venerable dumping ground for knick-knacks galore. The sugar bowl was exactly what I expected in terms of decor. and kitsch kitsch and more kitsch atmosphere where is the elateride parmalat when you need it",Bad
9111,"It saddens me to say that this is not the worst Mexican restaurant we have eaten at that is on Oahu near Waikiki Beach, but it is close, hell we had to drive by arrobas to get to this place. I had a chimichanga which was a little anemic, although the filling was ok, the beans, the tasteless rice looked the part, but as spicy as your average meal of boiled meat and root vegetables, the fajita salad also lacked pizzazz with all the appearance of being tasty. bland chicken generally unless there is an attempt to chew rather than cook I will order a basic dish but I don't shoot the chef and trust me these guys are safe from sand agents very safe first timer and if the beatrice sucks no comeback overall it feels like space aliens are running the place and they learned to cook from pictures this is definitely a mistake we we will not repeat",Very bad
1718,"I've been living in Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say they've gone down considerably over the last few years when I started living in my first property in MT. The front desk staff took the time to get to know you by name, kept up to date with any ongoing issues, and were proactive about things. years extra charges are even added for services you may or may not use anyway you have to pay the only reason I didn't give them a star is because of the maintenance staff they are what the front desk staff were friendly polite and very responsive to your issues they actually have a pretty similar opinion to the front desk people that's pretty telling",Bad
6348,"I'm new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood to have someone else make my breakfast for a change and came across all these rave reviews of Matts on Yelp. Normally I find the reviews on Yelp to be pretty much accurate and very honest. This is my first case of the opposite. extra star for using local ingredients, this place is below Waffle House and others on my list, the hash browns were more like a hash brown omelet that needed a few more minuets. I mashed raw potatoes in the middle, they easily take over a little too serious. the bread was good, nice thick slices of what appeared to be locally baked loaves, the jam that came with the toast was good too, but it was snatched away before I could finish. Overall this place is good for sheep who need to eat downtown but lacks anything for a reason to come back or recommend to anyone if you are in the area and considering eating here try somewhere else. options in the area give a chance to someone else who isn't counting on you to eat there because they were about to",Bad
8470,inexpensive for early bird special for combo plates which include spring roll soup rice and your selection if the food only had more seasoning or flavor it was very bland and flavorless I don't usually use soy sauce but I had to use it to add something to my dish with a pond of ki inside with a bridge over it,Good
7056,"this place was horrible i will never go back it was overpriced and the best thing i ate was the cornbread you get before the meal i had the filet mignon stuffed with chorizo ​​it was like chewing a piece of rubber stuffed with soy my girlfriend had flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas three words it sucked, sucked, sucked",Very bad
4719,"we wanted to take you for your last few dinners we were thinking about which place had specials on a Tuesday and I remembered that the copies had a special and a food challenge and that's how I ended up on copies on a Tuesday that they were featured on. I think it's man versus food but I'm not sure I'm into their food challenge on Tuesdays, they have an ace special of Jewish fries with the purchase of a drink to keep in mind a plate of Jewish fries, I've been told the specials here are sliders, the sliders themselves are a decent size, I say maybe it's the same size as the small mod burgers but the larger Jewish sliders have cakes in them potatoes. Western sliders don't make breakfast. Sliders are something completely different. friendly ink, I think most Arizonans in general are friendlier than the Californians I meet daily hahahhaa and our waitress did her best to split the checks for our group, that was pretty cool of her, I'm glad I went here for the experience but I won't be back, lesson learned, don't trust a bunch of inflexible boys hungry after the gym to choose a place for dinner",Bad
3901,"so going at Christmas was always a risk, there was a wait and the parties in front of my group left there, we people were waiting for their order for more than minutes but when we asked how long it would be before we sat down and got our food we were told a few minutes, he was true to his word that the food was good, the spring rolls were awesome, we didn't really have a waiter to look after us but it was ok, the bus gave us more of water when we asked, I would probably go again if I was in the area but I would just as soon have the panda",Good
6282,"a no frills hole in the wall burgers the burger is made to order delicious and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly fatty so you know you are eating the real deal the fixing bar is an interesting concept that I like because I can stack as many treats as I like the bar gets a little messy at times but hey whatever, the burgers aren't the cheapest but then again if you want cheap you go to a dollar menu no it's worth it and fight some of the students across the street at Phoenix College for a bite at the burger factory",Good
3624,"this place is hit or miss for me, I always ordered the feta gyro and either fries or a small greek salad, why is the soda machine always broken, I wonder what is broken and not fixed in the kitchen. I ate here for the th or th time on Thursday. with salad",Good
3907,"when the Tempe Market was being put together, wow, a classy place where college kids and casual adults could get together and have fun. The Cadillac Ranch was under construction and the hype was hot enough to make you buy a meal in advance, read the reviews but I thought they were trying it and now I see why it has two stars. to myself at least the food should be good, the sliders meal may have been scarce on meat but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small, yes the service was slow, my glass was refilled faster by the gentlemen than the waiter himself. The happy hour deal seems sort of appropriate, I recommend it if you're stuck hanging out in the Tempe market and you only have a few bucks and you're feeling like it's almost full and now I think the Tempe market has taken Mill Aves Lovely, they need to step up their efforts to compensate by killing a once ornate chill out spot because and shopping in Tempe is a goodie, the deaf might replace cr with maybe the banana that knows goodbye for now",Bad
524,"My colleague and I met for lunch this afternoon, the restaurant was understandably busy and there was a delay in the delivery of our food when my pear and potato omelette arrived, this caused mixed reactions. The omelette itself was served hot and loaded with bacon and cheese. The potatoes served on the side were still frozen in the middle. but throw some fresh potatoes on the plate the waiter said if the kitchen had to make the omelette again there might be a long delay, I could only respond with a shrug, he left and went to the kitchen with my plate several other people touched and forked the plate and potatoes before replacing them, he then took the plate back to me at the bar and not to my table end result good omelette potatoes mediocre subpar service and poor follow-up",Bad
3860,"Ronald's Italian Deli is a really good lunch spot if you're in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries. They are conveniently located near the corner of Deer Valley and next to Dunking Donuts. They are open for breakfast, lunch and early dinner. I recommend going there during breakfast or lunch if you are interested in the daily specials that are on their hot plates. cut salads loaded with just about anything you can imagine, they also have a small selection of homemade pasta salads, I also had their rye pastrami with their spiced opener and horseradish vinaigrette, the pastrami was very good but had to be heated in the microwave. deli in Phoenix but much better than any deli chain, it's a good alternative to burgers and fries",Good
8467,my name is christi and i'm addicted to bread with my pasta my lovers fancy pizza crust yes hash browns with my french toast i tried to quit but i can't and i also resigned myself to the theory of life so what does hay bring to starch i almost had a salad at bar louis because it was a pretty late dinner and i wanted to save room in my belly for the dirty martinis but they have a appetizer that I couldn't live without trying a hot pretzel sticks huge hot soft pretzels covered in salt served with simple cheese sauces and honey mustard dip but during my care I opted out that evening it was the tastiest thing I have ever eaten I can vouch for the pretzels but other than that the service blew pieces in minutes to get photos impatient when we were the only table in our waiters section when people impatiently order it means they are on a mission so give it to them quickly we canceled our drinks and left to drink wine in our hotel room we knew we would get drinks quicker there if you I'll go get the pretzels not for the impatient,Bad
4790,"horrible, I had a gel manicure, the teacher didn't let my old gel soak long enough so she scraped and filed so hard to remove it that it left my natural nail extremely thin and fragile. The new polish that was applied was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so fragile. What happened was that the gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I'll never come back and I'm sure I'm sorry I did in the first place.",Very bad
3078,"this place has no idea how much men's items are priced and I wouldn't recommend them at all. I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to it and they priced it for giving me a huge take home price. I understand the need to move merchandise quickly and naturally this sold out in a matter of days, but I can't understand why they wouldn't try to get more money for the item. I can only assume they didn't do their research before setting the price, consignor beware.",Very bad
4765,"I'm moving to Phoenix in the winter and thought I'd check out some fish while I was visiting, which led me to reef farming in the first place. I was positive seeing some nice displays and use of LEDs, but that quickly changed upon closer inspection. Many tanks were infested with aphasia and bubble algae and coral prices were extremely inflated compared to other prices in the area. to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby. I have had marine tanks for over a decade, ranging from large gallon to small, after that gross and humiliating experience I continued to go through the last few tanks and came across an anglerfish. slammed the phone, snapped his fingers at me and told me to stop harassing the fish, keep in mind I wasn't tapping the glass or pushing anything as I'm quite short and could barely reach the high tank where the anglerfish were much less within reach of harassing any fish after this rude treatment I quickly left this kind of unprofessional treatment of guests is shocking and unacceptable, let alone the tanks infested with bubble algae, a spore of this on the water you put your coral in and your tank is also infected, I will not do business here when I move",Very bad
3439,"I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me, maybe it was me, I don't know, that's exactly how I felt when my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said al Molina and I was like you mean the guy who played doc rock in Epidermal. I've been here several times today, this was my first time in El Moline in about months. My office, one thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom, it's something very typical, like a gas station where the bums use to shit on the floor. I went to the bathroom and he told me I had to ask for the key. em but don't you have something chips that I can buy for a dollar that comes with a much more reasonable serving size I have all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday probably the burrito I got was very tasty the salsa they gave me was also super good nice and smoky and spicy seriously man that shit was spicy I kind of have a sore throat today so that spiciness felt really good I had to laugh when I opened it my togo back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I hadn't had salsa but when I took a look they gave me so much I did a little spin next to my meal like a stonehenge of three star heat good not great bathroom weird unfriendly lady good food overpriced",Good
6727,"Came here the other night at a party, overall the experience was satisfactory, the waitresses were nice yes, some had serious cleavage and they were mostly on top of the situation, they ordered the kids' plates first and got drinks. the hot sauce overall it exceeded my expectations which weren't too high given what i read here the plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull only one person in our group did it after pictures of jack daniels overall it's a great place to go if you're looking for a casual place with decent food and side entertainment",Good
2889,"star for service and attitude the food was delicious but the staff was very hateful I'm writing this review I don't remember the name of the waitress but I remember she was short hispanic and was pregnant at the time she was incredibly hateful, hateful and rude to me and my parents. I dress differently, more manly, different waitresses, same good food, same hateful attitudes. I will urge everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to another pizza place or pizza place to get better service.",Very bad
9342,"I bought a deal from Living Social and waited a while to call them, thinking they were swamped with business now I can't get them to call me back so I can use my deal note. There were no reviews for this company on Yelp prior to the Living Social offer. Of course Living Social doesn't help, their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area, that sort of thing, I predict this will be the demise of every dealoftheday site, the company selling the deal is at no risk of having to pay refunds if the company supplies the goods. or the services are not working, I have since canceled my subscriptions to all dealoftheday emails, lesson learned on two unethical companies",Very bad
5441,"I was a little disappointed after reading the reviews here. I had the fajitas, my wife had the tacos, I didn't think the green inferno chiles were that hot, the taco meat wasn't spicy and bland, the best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips, even the salsa wasn't anything great, at least the beer was cold in a pitcher, it better be",Bad
6506,"I went there tonight before the game, the best thing about the whole bar was their shirts, I really wanted the shirt that said you looked like you could have a drink anyway, I had the nachos, bad choice, drenched in cheese sauce and melted cheese, beans, cheese, peppers, cheese, tomatoes and oh, headcheese, it was a soggy mess and it was huge. I have to give it minus another star for the horrible music they play seriously. If I'm going to see a game I don't think house and dance music is the way to go, but also to each their own, but I had to shorten the time during the game because I started getting soggy nachos maybe.",Good
795,"first of all the hours this place keeps the most absurd hours for a restaurant serving students and faculty, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to get a sandwich and the bags have been closed, they open in the morning and close around or in the afternoon. I can't say definitively what the times are because they don't list them on the bags website, apparently they are trying to keep that a secret. I understand that a sandwich shop in downtown Phoenix is ​​keeping these hours, but here is an update for bag owners as students and faculty are not keeping bank hours. food quality is poor but sandwiches are reasonably priced",Bad
5005,"well I wouldn't have the dragon lady roll again but the humans were good and the rainbow roll was good, too many cream cheese and mayonnaise rolls on this menu, not even busy on a Sunday night with the bus game in town, nice atmosphere",Bad
7886,"a nice place to watch a game, it's open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you consider your many dining alternatives. They also let in natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time. Anyway, I don't have a good reason to give this place one star or five stars, so three stars.",Good
8214,"I had seen them before, but never stopped with a drink menu and was quite happy with a good selection of margaritas and such. The dinner menu was good too, the drinks were excellent and the food was tasty. I will make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink, ask.",Good
6462,"pretty decent place right in the heart of the action, saw some separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio, they have a few different peaks, those facts alone made it a successful venture did I mention it was midday on a Friday",Good
287,"First, I hope the management of La Fonda reads these reviews and takes action to improve their restaurant. Second, we also miss the Bloody Mary Bar, my husband I visited a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner, we asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made up something that was ridiculously wrong, okay she doesn't know beer, we liked the chip salsa, that was a good start, then I took a sip of my water, I know what tap water tastes like at tempe, but it was weird the aftertaste. made me cringe I couldn't drink it even with a slice of lemon in it maybe it was the ice cream my husband ordered chicken enchiladas which he orders almost everywhere and it was so bad he didn't finish it my meal wasn't memorable either I wanted to like this place or at least that way we left there terribly disappointed I doubt we will return",Very bad
7105,"for a small sandwich with an egg, two greasy strips of bacon and a stale muffin, they say it's expensive because they buy it locally, it must have substance to be considered something so gross",Very bad
7304,"Honestly I love cupcakes like I said in my nasty bakery review eating a cupcake unlike a slice of cake gives a feeling of accomplishment I love cupcakes I love the feeling of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake you may have had a hard day but you finished a whole cupcake which is validation it makes me happy. light chocolate cake style with cream cheese frosting, I disagree, I don't detect any cream cheese flavor in this frosting, the first time I devoured a chip cupcake it was magical, I was particularly impressed by the dark and white Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting. my car, a baba subaru and the cupcakes seemed quite big again, I have to think consuming a sprinkled cupcake in the sun wouldn't be a good idea, the cupcake to eating space ratio would be quite bad for real cupcake validation, I'll drive the miles to the bad guy, ok you caught me, I might pass as an emergency fix if I'm around but I'll think of the bad guy's slave and consume my confection in a small space",Good
5889,"I liked the concept, the staff was very good, the food tasted like it was reheated in the microwave and cold on the top and hot on the bottom after watching our movie. We wanted to buy tickets a week in advance for another movie. We went to customer service and asked if they knew if the shade would be played on the bride and groom. and hard to order tickets, I looked for tickets for tomorrow and it says show time is not available, looks like they don't want anyone to come see movies after spending on food and movie, I think I'll try another place",Bad

2487,"I'm a book addict, I'm sure libraries are my Mecca, but I'm hard to get a spy card, it was a breeze. I only needed one proof of residency, even though I brought all three recommendations, including a Netflix envelope, once I had my card I was ready to explore. I first headed to the public computers that help you locate books. Yes, with pieces of paper and mini-pencils at hand. I found my book morphing into another section, from fiction to large print, I decided to turn this hunt into a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the section names, and finally got acquainted with the library system. Don't get me wrong, it's not rocket science, nor is it pop rocks having found my books and some dads that I checked out very easily too. ready to find at least one of the books on my no list, so I put a few on hold for myself and wandered around very disappointed. That's when I started not liking this library, any of my books, really, this library is not user friendly like others, I saw even the library in Stillwater Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. a man who volunteered there showed me how to use the self checkout system, he was a friendly man who assumed I knew nothing about self checkout machines and probably doubted my ability to read as he explained to me step by step what I needed to do to check out my books at least the lesson was in depth enough for me to fully understand it and more so the next time I went to snoop to retrieve the books I had put on hold I used self checkout I was in and out in minutes so let's recap the book slip slip doesn't always have the books you want sad face you can renew online create a profile and share reviews you can place books on hold from any computer if you are logged into your account the people who work there are friendly it's easy to get a card just bring your sip bill like I did it's not an easy place to navigate the spy doesn't make you want to spend hours there there are private rooms but you don't know how you book them there are monthly activities at the library but mostly about holdfast diets and how to use microsoft word there is free parking in the shade you can check your items yourself with their self checkout it's quite ugly inside the lifeless dull brown seat",Good

4219,"a little disappointed, we were waiting for the right time to visit this place and today happened to be that day, first of all the location is in the middle of what appears to be a ghost town. The interior had lots of character with items like the family John Deer tractor. Anyway, we had the full slab with sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink. Honestly, I expected more from this place. same price, sit back and relax while they serve you and the food is better, a little out, priced for a cafeteria style, I think it's a bit too much food, not the least important to us, very classic decor and full of character. I just received a very nice message from the owner, Joe, I think it's wonderful that Joe cares about each customer's comments and reviews, even though my review wasn't very positive. happy",Good
5780,"I had dinner at Rama Thai a couple of days ago, it wasn't a horrible dining experience but I'm not sure I'll go back my friend and I ordered the spring rolls sorry I don't remember the name Thai and they were two pieces small but the price was then what I expected and an average filling that I would expect from frozen spring rolls we are both vegetarian and were happy to see a vegetarian section on the menu but were slightly disappointed with the options three of the items included oyster sauce and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or rescreen vegetable curry. I ordered the green curry vegetables medium hot and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables mild and she stressed mild. We waited a few minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish, it was way spicier than average, but I didn't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny and the vegetables were soggy and looked like they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. it was worth it the service was slow but the waitresses were very friendly overall I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant to a friend",Bad
9183,"the food is simple, plain and simple, you taste and hopefully enjoy every ingredient, but as with most minimally processed cooked foods they don't travel well so eat in, luckily the decor is modern and complements the menu well making eating in a pleasure. My only negative note is on the service. If you are not careful when entering the restaurant, you can enter through the invisibility door and will become invisible to the employees. your invisible fades based on my late lunch experience today the dust takes a few minutes to remove email replies or texts from the iPhone unfortunately I only had three unanswered emails in my mail and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees on a positive note when you leave no matter how long you waited the invisibility dust seems to be removed I know this because no one honked or yelled at you my car while it was leaving without a driver",Very bad

1236,"I don't understand the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant, but the need to create a mockery and make fun of the fact that the word mockery appears in the menu no less than many times and it made me want to run away, tell, tell mach, I don't care, I understand this from a marketing strategy aimed at attracting and/or converting carnivores and omnivores. I guess meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it's shaped like a chicken wing. medallions, I am also aware that we eat with our eyes have preconceived notions about certain types of cuisine and yet I strongly believe that if an establishment uses vegetables, legumes, tofu and the like and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the wheel of meat, the end result would be much better, for example the mexicali hamburger, no reference to meat here, how about listing something like whatever it is served at the parmesan way, I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the cool space corner, it was open colorful and inviting a few lines of organs a small space in the front, nice mild funk flavor in the decor, the order is done counter style and they present it to you, you instead go behind the counter to get ice for your drink which I thought was a little weird. stunned me, I think it may have been crispy long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just large amounts of rooster sauce, uh, Sirach saved it from Blandsville, I'm not saying I'd never come back as I tend to give places more than one chance. I like well-prepared vegetarian dishes, but don't make fun of me.",Bad
1154,"I had never been to Rainforest Café and I'm glad I got to try it because I like to try things at least once, but this will also be the last time I go there. We will start from the beginning. The atmosphere was nice for the jungle but it was so loud I couldn't hear my wife talking to me. It was too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive, we sent it back so she could have water, later food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was simple and so expensive for something so simple I got onion rings for a few dollars more they were okay but worth the extra few dollars, my wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few dollars but they didn't give her more than ten. I'm sick that night, not as amazing as I thought after seeing it several times in Vegas",Very bad
1767,"maybe it's because I've never met a bowl of someone I didn't like, but I could gulp down this stuff all day, the kitchen does a decent job with them, the broth is so delicious and soothing, I've never had that in all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to and here's what I didn't like about the kitchens with a view, the chicken is a bit dry and tasteless, the broth has a ton of flavor so when you take a bite of chicken with the broth is good, but eating it alone is way too much. all they have to do is season it a little before cooking it. The spring rolls were also very fresh and excellent dipped in the sauce without the sauce, they would have been a little dry too overall, this is my place for that as it is so close to home.",Good
9130,"the kids and I love Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired, we have been here a long time and every time I wonder why I go back to this one, the service there is almost rude, they seem bored of being busy, they never seem happy to serve you, the drinks take forever to make even though they are not as busy as the others, we won't even get into the fact that my order was ruined the last few times, the main problem that I have is the fact that out of time when to sit and relax with a snack, someone really needs to sweep the floor near me while I sit there, there are much better Starbucks and I think I will try others locally, kids and I went today for our snack, I wanted to say things were better today, I won't change my rating until my next visit",Bad

1399,"Breadfruit is a nice place, the interior of the place is well decorated and they only seat people creating an intimate and pleasant ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and cage-free. Any downtown Jamaican restaurant addition deserves at least three stars in my book. I liked that the wonton was baked and not fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the buns themselves lacked flavor. I really wish they would have combined other fruits or spices to add more contrast to the dish for my main course. the chef owner came over and asked us how we enjoyed our meal and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent but compared to other Jamaican places I've been this really only deserves stars sorry.",Good
8182,"not a good experience last night at Eastward I'll start off by saying I've been eating here for over years when it was Tokyo Express and now eastward I was a weekly customer when I lived closer now it's every day or so we went to dinner and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant we were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with a server as she was constantly at their table she was there while we waited and obviously saw us before finally showing us a table. The waiter was a guy who must have been new because he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu, so we ordered the sushi sample for me and the Korean beef and vegetable roll for her. I got the sushi but not the salad and soup which came with the vegetable roll turned into an egg roll, it all arrived at once and the waiter didn't come back until we were finished after consulting with the waiter he took away the egg roll and our drink guess that's supposed to make up for it.",Bad

I loved their stacks of Latin American fashion clothing and the artwork on the walls was beautiful. They also had ice water to serve you. My favorite thing to do was go down to the Danielle store downtown and get some coffee at the Royal and some of their rosemary shortbread cookies, it doesn't look delicious but trust me they are sure to ask for it the moment I went, the place obviously wasn't crowded and I received attentive service.",Good

I need Pitt brush tip markers in Castle fiber, same story with airbrush equipment, come back Tuesday or Thursday or call us and we will check if it is there. I can walk to Jerry's without thinking, but I'd rather go to an art center or somewhere else than have to call in overtime. the clerks I have dealt with are some of my rants from the handful I have dealt with mostly in the morning and day, it seems like they don't really know the store that well or don't care to give any insight into their products or business, they have a large store and I understand there is a lot of inventory to know and locate but that's your job, it seems like no one I have dealt with there really knows their stuff. I talked to a girl there who was really chatting to me. her recent art party where she painted this huge room and blah blah blah but when I asked her if she knew when they might have more brush tip markers she was mom no idea Jerry just clean it up and ask your people to act towards you and your customers with the same passion they have with their own art do it and I will try to love you again",Bad

The food is where I saw the problem, my mac cheeseburger was bland and tasteless, my broccoli and cheese soup was below average, I wasn't impressed at all, we ended up having dessert, I opted for a single chocolate malt brunch ball, which I had never had before and didn't like total personal preference as my friend liked it, macalpines are cool but I think it's purely a place to get something sweet",Good

She walked away and as we were loudly discussing our loss of interest in dining there, she returned with napkins and utensils and asked if we had decided what we were going to have. I wanted to send it back where the pretty bowl was and was the presentation of the last dessert I had here serious in presenting us with this stale mousse with cracked edges and the green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it I don't know about you but the only time I saw crystals on ice cream was when it melted slightly and put it back in the freezer to refreeze for me seeing crystals on the ice cream is a sign it is old I brought the container over and showed it to the male host who assured me that all the mousse is prepared daily and it is normal to see cracks and bubbles in the mousse so I decided to try it if only to have something to report here. The dessert definitely didn't live up to the lovely bowl I had on our October in terms of taste and presentation, but it was ok. the dish because the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a good combo to her, I told her to trust me, she also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert. I understand that having to serve only dessert instead of dinner and dessert which results in a higher table bill can be a little disappointing but why do you have to show your displeasure to your guests but you were lucky that my cousin even left you change for a tip that she didn't want to give you anything and you definitely didn't deserve it when I told other friends on Yelp about the subpar service and dessert we just have one who responded that she didn't enjoy it the last time we had monkeys here I think it was around Halloween and first Friday neither cousin and I found it in very poor taste that our server gave us this horrible condescending look after finding out we were just going to get a dessert we didn't deserve I will never recommend noble to anyone again. i need to find somewhere else to take her i don't want to risk getting the same treatment but or from another server should we come back here sorry noble but i won't be back",Very bad

Lucille is in a good location, it's located near Dave and Buster's in Tempe Market, the look of the place is gimmicky but in a bit of a famous way they have old school signs to drink from and all the little fake things to make you feel like you've been to Memphis or wherever they were trying to transport you, the service was absolutely terrible, took a long time to get drinks and even longer to get refills, attitude all the time, here's a tip if you want a good tip then you will have more money to pay your tuition. Half the staff are students and don't roll their eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions, they tell you they smoke all their meats in house. chicken tips and ribs with a side of greens and sweet potato fries the chicken was good it had smoke on it and was tender no real complaints portion size was good the brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork that hard maybe too many smoked portions tiny strips maybe or inches long the rib tips were dry and covered in sauce almost no meat on them most places in the valley charge you for rib tips when you order it's cheap meat but not this place you get a spoon full of disgusting collard greens cooked in weird pork parts and they were bitter the greens aren't supposed to be bitter if they're cooked properly sweet potato fries you can't really mess with them they probably came frozen so I would recommend them over regular fries the starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird weird weird weird and the biscuit Wasn't even hot enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter one last thing the house and hot sauces the main ingredients are corn syrup that the way they thicken it seriously that should tell you something overall two thumbs down stay away there are plenty of other great ones there are places in the valley",Bad

The result provides practical answers to the following questions about frozen yogurt. from nuts to the big brand crushed candies available, the quality is pretty close to that of most relevant competitors as long as one doesn't demand the desert honey sweet Republic pie variant, but correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most customers won't mind the slight drop in exchange for the flexibility of purchasing only as much yogurt and toppings as desired while still satisfying one's acclimated children with a frankenstein of saccharine flavors and unwanted toppings as well as city guests looking for the nearest ink with an original tart plus kiwi ripe strawberries and pineapple",Good

Jennifer said sharply that we are busy, apparently on Saturdays they are busy and you should avoid doing business there on the weekend. I don't remember being spoken to so rudely, even in a fast food restaurant, in recent years. make another appointment I had made I was told it would take another two minutes because I had to go through their background check to be a member, they were having difficulty with my Washington driver's license and the strange characters, there is an asterisk in part of the number after all was said and done over an hour later I was approved to become a member and was successfully put in as a signer on my mother's account. to this I received a response, she didn't have one, the woman sitting next to her informed me that she was the assistant manager and they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest problem was if it was going to take an hour to speak with someone, tell me I can make other arrangements or come during the week and first telling me it shouldn't be long and then saying we're busy is no excuse. the line or not open on Saturdays as a 1 year veteran in the service industry I am very disappointed in the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union has provided to my mom and I but also everyone else I have seen being laid off as if the credit union is doing them a favor after looking for a new home for moms money they can get a much better rate at an upcoming four letter bank.

I remember before they briefly closed the campus for renovation, a girl falling through the auditorium wall and pieces of ceiling falling on people's heads before condemning it. more and more buildings kept collapsing, they decided to close the school and reopen it under the same name on the new campus, they spent a hell of a lot of money on a very high end theater in exchange for letting it be used for official government events, no one knew how to use it, that was one of the best things about it. morning video announcements because we used the phrase coming out and they thought the phrase might be offensive and then that same week the football team had a video where they were all pretending to be gay, talking with a lisp and waving limp wrists when I went to the office to ask which they told me, that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. often and it never showed up in my file, I remember when Miss Lee would dress up as a hard rocker with tattoos for Halloween and the administrators would make her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friend's boyfriend got suspended because they searched his car for drugs on an anonymous tip and found a box cutter in his trunk that he used for work and kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school. the inspiration for the film turned up the volume which was filmed in the general area when I left the softball team the coach school counselor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to convince me to play again when we took pictures for the badminton team we didn't have enough uniforms for the whole team I felt like I was in a prison or high security mental institution. i had worked to keep patients calm i never had a chemistry class my two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent a whole year talking about shakespeare and another who said slaves didn't have it that bad my biology book was so old it had my friend's mother's name in it years ago and that same friend's mother warned me against my biology teacher mr h if he ever tells you to be alone after class, don't do the good things i remember mrs total sp a very good and supportive english teacher miss lee the best photography and video teacher I always had the best Halloween costumes at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and told stories about the horny lady sneaking off campus to go to Barrows pizza.

I went back inside, admired a much better Michael Jackson cover, and realized that the one thing I couldn't find here was fun for a Westsider like me. Tempe is a mecca for mischief, a place where I can have one too many and come home with a story to tell. lack of pretty here it's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go anywhere else came and had a guinness in peace i came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a blown club and instead of having a happy medium i ended up with a boring dive don't get me wrong i love dive bars but i don't go to mill avenue for them the rule is a good place with a good history i can't hate on it i love the interior and i saw me coming back during the day it's just not worth going out my way on a Saturday night",Good

I was expecting a quiet wine bar, but instead it felt more like a loud nightclub. My husband and I visited the lounge on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole wewishwewereaclub thing was only once a week and maybe I'm not cool at all, but we have no plans to return. and the price was good, the food was average, we had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad, way too much dressing on both salads, it took a long time to get a feel for the table, but it was Saturday night and it was busy so that was to be expected once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us, she wasn't very attentive at all, she asked for my order and walked away. remote, my husband was like umm, I kinda wanted to order too, the overall vibe of the place is pretty neat, it's a smaller restaurant with a lot going on. The outdoor patio seating decor is large, heavy curtains and lots of couches, hence the lounge's name, but as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had difficulty playing music so loud that it was impossible to have a conversation and we ended up sitting quite far from the speakers which we left as soon as we finished our dinners.",Bad

Yes, this is the place to see in Scottsdale. the veggie roll and the Kobe beef sliders, the tuna was okay nothing to write home about the rolls were really small also there was so much eel sauce on the chenille roll that when I went to pick up a piece it fell partly into a soggy mess in my soy sauce that splattered all over my freshly dry cleaned cream colored silk blouse the lovely spicy salmon was standard nothing special I enjoyed the veggie roll the most the biggest of what we ordered it was crunchy and tasty the Kobe beef sliders were delicious but seriously who spoils the Kobe beef there is one thing that bothers me when dining at a sushi restaurant asking for more ginger emphasizing a lot more ginger and not receiving it or receiving a small pinch I made requests to two waiters and after minutes of waiting I was brought literally three pieces call me picky but seriously the ginger is fucking Japanese condiment, show me the silver or the ginger in this case I wish to come back to try some hibachi, the aromas wafting around the place from the hot tables were intoxicating, maybe they will redeem themselves with more ginger",Good

I admit the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best I've ever had. My lady had the pork tenderloin which had a strange peppery and sweet accord that I didn't particularly like. overall this place was pretty disappointing, i honestly thought it would be much more cozy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't, it presents itself as being so upscale and french and oglala wee wee, but in the end it's still located in a little shack of a house down the street and in the highlands, maybe if it was located in baltimore i would give it a little more credit",Very bad

Visiting and local friends we chose to try this place as we approach the bar entrance, security tells us we are not welcome here as one of our group does not have closed toed shoes and another does not have a collared shirt. The outfit our group wore was more than appropriate for any Phoenix Scottsdale restaurant, let me remind you that it is July in Phoenix and it is over a hundred degrees at night time. popular restaurant, the staff were downright rude not only to us but to other people wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.

I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room and then taken to a room with a giant crystal used to help calm the intention and awareness of your visit and yourself. The woman who showed me around was very professional. and thorough although informative, I was expecting a warm connection from him and I never received it after being shown to the locker room, I changed into my swimsuit and waited in the ladies lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience. I chose a male provider knowing I had tension knots and stress. I was hoping for a slow, firm relaxing massage. I've had many massages and this one was actually a bit disappointing. the relaxing experience I was craving my massage therapist was very kind and genuine in his approach I was just hoping for something more I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience the facilities were amazing they were clean and always stocked with towels I have to say the spa attendants were rocked I couldn't believe how efficient they were I observed on some occasions yes every time a shower was free an attendant was there to clean it every time a towel was on the floor she was immediately picked up they worked together like a well oiled machine and I would love to give them props for making me take note of the work, do I plan to come back I may not get a massage because of my experience but I really enjoyed the facilities and staff.

I can't say, I won't order them again, I ordered a sandwich and since he has to be on a special diet he can't eat mayonnaise, he reads the ingredients very closely and asks for things he can't leave out, his sandwich came covered in mayonnaise even though it wasn't listed on the menu as an ingredient when we looked for our server he was nowhere to be found, so while I was munching on messy tacos I had looking sad for the next few minutes until we finally saw the waiter and reported him. The server was great at making the new sandwich without mayonnaise and we even got an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt, they were delicious and when you see their homemade chipotle ketchup try it, I looked for it in the gift shop in Baltimore but they didn't have any for sale.

I have tried Latin American foods including Yucatan Oaxaca Belize so my knowledge is zero on Venezuelan foods but I have taste buds and experiences of various food cultures overall it was rubbish I was referring to the variety of tastes and uniqueness it was not worth my money my friend and I asked the media to lump the regular portion together for the large plates came with a large portion of steamed white rice small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese half a fried egg avocado regular Chinese style I cooked all the time simple areas round flatbreads a chorizo sausage a blood sausage pieces of shredded beef a small steak a few green plantains and a few sweet plantains the blood sausage tasted burnt tired I had blood sausage much tastier, softer and more colorful than the blood sausage I grew up with delicious, maybe that's why I'm being vicious now heed my warning it's not good for cholesterol the steak has a savory flavor it's regular although I believe it's reduced to an ounce the shredded beef reminds me of sloppy joe it's good for the taste sweet plantains are regular fried plantains like you find in some Chinese buffets or regular dessert menus it's good for sweetness but nothing more than that in this restaurant if you give me a steamed bun or a roll of silver thread both are steamed rice paste I can tell how much salt it contains the satisfaction of chewing the freshness and the distinct aroma steamed and I can eat it in single areas that is to say it's a tasteless and odorless fluffy treat that didn't excite my taste buds a bit boring honestly I didn't have no idea how special it was supposed to be it tasted better after stuffing the avocado and shredded beef inside the green plantains were like hard cardboard fried care no taste but it has a green tinted color my friend also ordered some really tiny tequenos fried breaded cheese sticks for each chinese egg the rolls are each twice as big and they are fattier and tastier i'm not a size queen the quest for ham empanada was so small with a bite, come on you're kidding me, the calzones are more complicated and much bigger with ham and cheese and even more ingredients for a similar price. serve, pay a salary and rent the space, we were the only table that evening, the wait service was ordinary between a bus boy and minimalist, the ambiance was simple and it wasn't a place you would expect to pay for two before the group, so diners get the chance to have a different cultural experience.

6364,"the place has a nice little vibe and they have some unique items, but the reason the rating is so low is because there really aren't many options that don't involve fake meat. Aren't these people vegan, don't they hate the idea of ​​poor little animals being our food even if that's the only reason they are alive, so why so much fake meat, I will never understand the craving for meat, vegans and vegetarians. not as healthy as lean fresh meats like chicken and fish Friday I love meat but every now and then I like to have a vegetarian dish another negative is that almost everything is fried, I guess they are busting the myth that people are vegan because it's healthier frying things is the cheap way to create a healthy and tasty meal. I'll give them one star because what we chose was pretty tasty, but with almost every option involving fake meat and tofu, it's definitely a disappointment. If you want legit vegan food, try Indian places or the Ethiopian places are very creative and use spices to flavor a vegetable dish. Fake cheese and meats are for meat-envying vegans, not omnivores who just want a good meal, keep your expectations in check and you should be fine.",Bad

We started with the chips and salsa for the delicious table. disappointing I made the joke that it was leftovers from the kitchen and it looked like a light tomato broth with a bunch of veggies a piece of cheese and a small cob of corn on top yes a small cob of corn is on top it was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it we ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and half a pound of veggies thanks to the vegetarian fiancée it went surprisingly far for five of us but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one red on top, they should be lush with peppers and onions that were grilled or maybe even caramelized. Onions Daniel e wrote in his review the same concern that there should be more than a pile of onions which he expected. At least a few green, red or yellow peppers. on almost everything it's such a shame that this place has to be Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine this time, the service was really lousy and my fiancee found a bug at the bottom of her water very disappointing.

Real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building. bowls and salads, the food was pretty good although it didn't knock my socks off. I ordered the baba bowl which is described on their online menu as southwest chicken over garlic rice, black beans, monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pick de gallo. helped me with the flavor but I had replaced the rice with organic brown rice which didn't add much flavor the sour cream wasn't lime there was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl I wouldn't bother ordering it again especially if I'm craving southwestern food on another recent visit I ordered a wrap called prince de thais spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach garlic rice ginger salad fresh slice of cucumber and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla that had better flavor than the baba bowl the vegetable ingredients were fresh and good again I wasn't very impressed with the chicken pieces, one thing I think a wrap needs to address is the use of Styrofoam cupsapteral, their slogan is healthy food for a hungry planet and they have a link to a new green restaurant for vegan food on their website for such an artsy and earthy place, I would have thought it's a wrap would have made more conscious ecological choices for that reason and the bland chicken, I only give them an average rating",Good

The drinks are reasonably priced for Scottsdale and they had some good specials last night, ranging from beer to whiskey to cinnamon to vodka, so your bases should be covered. on all kinds of people as they left old town Scottsdale, so tell the wise guys not to drink and drive",Good

My husband finally said ok, I'm the customer, I'll make our sandwiches and then I'll take care of your problems. They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us and then basically ignored us. I didn't order it and after telling the girl she said I thought you said the order was still wrong, phew",Very bad
9412,"I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean a British themed pub in Heritage Square, so promising that when you walk in the bartender is standing behind it in an elaborate wooden bar structure, it made me think of a publican instead of a bartender, as at my mate's I'll have a pint and have rooms available on the day, which is probably the idea, as there was a lovely selection of dry ales. We wandered over to the bar on the right and ordered a few pints. I ordered a boddingtons. It was nice if they had some old weird on tap but you can't have it all because of the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandmother's house, this prompted us to head out to the patio decorated with very heavy wooden furniture. I suppose this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. The pipeline music selection that evening was a bit compensating. Wham and Depeche Mode, I assume George Michael and David are British, indeed, Wikipedia has just informed me that Dave Than Born May, in Upping Essex, England, is the baritone singer of the English electronic group Depeche Mode and is also an accomplished solo artist. Now I feel better. the British expats in the valley are very happy, I'll probably come back to try the food at some point but for another round of drinks I think I'll wait until a Friday or Saturday night when things get going",Good

Customers often have to move dirty plates, stacking them on another table's trays just to get seated. My recommendation to the owners is to install trash cans like every other place in Eastwood self bus and have us do it if you don't. I have to wonder what happens to all these half-filled salsas. are squirt bottles left on tables unrefrigerated for so long refilled and put back into service or are they emptied and washed before refilling? I sincerely hope that very soon I will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal by then I must advise you to drive a little further south to my patio or north to Sylvia la Canasta.",Bad

Luckily I had my iPod, it was exploding and I could still hear them banging, it wasn't a very clean place either. I was going to ask if they had a wife but I just took it out of there, instead this place is small too and their book selection is limited, I was looking for a place to go to read, work and drink coffee in my area, arrowhead and this one is definitely crossed off my list, come here to try and find a book, but don't expect to relax and enjoy your novel or whatever if you like people watching, although it might be at you, there are all kinds here ps and i left my coffee cup far away in this shitty place like i would go back and get it, i think i would burn it first, too bad",Bad

There are some real perks about this place, they have daycare and lots of mirrors so I can watch my fat move while I run on the treadmill. gutted and totally renovated, you just feel an unpleasant humidity when you walk in the door which only gets worse the longer you are there and it's even worse during the summer, the guys always have the weight benches dominated, there is never any availability for machines of any kind from the afternoon onwards and then it starts to clear up bla la la bla considering it's the Baltimore location, a huge disappointment",Very bad

I'm not sure I would make a long drive to the Dragon Palace as chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby but if you live in the th and third ward it's definitely a Chinese food place worth trying as far as the food we ordered the Beijing dinner for which came with wonton soup a pu pu platter consisting of won tons yum sign up a small fried shrimp a beef skewer glazed and honey chicken Peking fried rice fried rice with shrimp chicken pork and beef Mongolian beef and the homemade chicken as an aside and a disclaimer, I prefer it at the moment and have developed a severe aversion to chicken which means I of course hated chicken dishes, my husband thought it was okay, I really liked the wonton soup and Peking fried rice after dinner, we had the requisite fortune cookie, express yourself now what and a really delicious banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with sugar glaze, overall it was a good time at a very good Chinese food restaurant",Good

Hundreds of businesses in the area close every year and there are more real estate signs in the malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts and I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry-eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment queue if you own a coffee shop, coffee should be your passion if you own a bait shop, fishing should be your passion if you just want to open a business that reflects a popular chain nearby, short and tall, please stop wasting space in the mall and get a day job in a cubicle never coming back warning my friends about this place and I will probably contact the health department on Monday",Very bad

A trip to this slightly more interesting center Parking can be difficult, but there are lots lining the back of the center as well as a valet parking lot in front of the central park that people watching is quite entertaining, from children frolicking in the fountains to desert Barbie siblings.

I have to reveal the ugly truth, they make no effort to sanitize the pedicure tools or bowl. explains why my scars cracked so badly after my pedicure that they started bleeding. I had to use peroxide newspaper and bandages for almost a week to get them to heal. They diluted their nail polish so much that it destroys the bond and the polish never dries. I hate to disparage a company with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable. I obviously won't come back.",Very bad

I have eaten here twice the first time I ordered shades ranchers and coffee today. the manager who located my server for me, the food itself is not bad but nothing to write home about The protein pancakes were huge and dense but not as tasty as one would expect from an item filled with almonds, blueberries and cinnamon, as others have noted, they will serve you on side orders, sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for the unevenness, well, it doesn't affect the food, but the decor is garish and simple, remember the first apartment you had after college with the white walls and beige carpet is basically the USA. egg aesthetic",Bad

2318,"for a chain or restaurant in general with a wing in the name, this place really doesn't impress if all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings, and sports, sure I'll fit that bill, but it won't hold up perceptibly. the wings are just average sized, the sauce selection is good, the hot one is quite hot but not extremely flavorful, I guess it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about, I won't continue to promote a bunch of local bars or chains that do the same thing with wing beer. and sport, oh okay I'll do New York zips and teakwoods originally from Hazelwoods, all do something better than wild wings",Bad

I don't know John and I don't know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their workplace. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner bragged about the food which I always order. in fact he goes into detail about how great Carla is, it's nice to see a man standing up for his wife, that would almost make me add a star up there, but sorry I can't make his inappropriate use of the possessive apostrophe repeatedly undo that, ok now that was insignificant, my bad id advises John to focus on things other than trolling and chastising his own clients whose business supports this luxury painting and the famous zombie staff, maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they're not focused on creating. a positive experience for their customers I honestly remain perplexed as to why John would bother bothering me. I go to a small restaurant to find the owner bragging, this is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring the owners and how they behave regarding the personal attack on Carla. Once I doubt anyone reading my review would call this person a braggart based on my experience and as I said before it hasn't stopped me from going back, I will come back, I will order the food and I will enjoy the food but since that is not the only part of the dining experience I will tolerate the negative things because the food I order regularly is always good.",Bad

I have no idea how people can eat this, oh and this waiter who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad, there is a nice picture on the wall that shows you what the salad is supposed to look like and it's not lettuce, the best thing about my meal was the fountain drink which cost circle k on the same room for bigger cups for pennies",Very bad

1694,"I always hate giving bad reviews, but our service left a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things, but it became clear that our poor service was no accident. We arrived and were told the food would only be served until that was no problem at all except our waitress didn't come back with the menus until almost 2 hours in and then came back to take our orders just a few minutes before the place had other customers, but it certainly wasn't busy enough to take an hour to receive our orders, unfortunately on each of our visits. the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused the food itself was quite good the shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marks were actually perfectly spiced and not worth getting excited about but they were certainly ok and reasonably priced considerably later in the evening our waitress came back with the bill there was an extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly saying to take it off but we had a good five minutes so that she kept getting lost in our seemingly very complicated instructions on the credit card, the rest in cash which she continually read back to overly complex scenarios and we asked her to simply put twenty on the card that was it when she came back she had taken our money for the bill charged to the card and kept the rest in cash as a tip which is just below the tip she assigned herself. We spoke to the manager who couldn't find her for a while and when she arrived she blamed us repeatedly, she finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill with the extra drink, it wasn't worth chatting at that time, the saddest thing is that everyone at my table and our surrounding tables started telling similar stories from past visits.

6100,"It seems like dining rooms are popping up all over the valley these days, Studio Movie Grill in north Scottsdale recently opened its doors. The theater has a much less luxurious feel than the Esplanade Am or even epic theaters instead of comfortable reclining seats. You're stuck sitting up straight and you won't have blankets to keep you warm. Although ordering food or drinks from your server is as easy as pressing the button on your seat, they will come pick up your order, the menu is full of Esplanade-like American dishes and they will deliver them to you throughout the movie. Movie tickets are Sunday, Friday, and Saturday, which is much cheaper than Epic and about the same price at the plaza. beer which I thought was a good deal considering we had two beers each to eat. I had a grilled cheese sandwich with fries. I actually really liked this grilled cheese sandwich because the bread was thick and there was lots of cheese and the seasoned fries were thick and tasted good. Some regular movie concession stand items at non-dinein theaters are just as expensive, so I thought the food prices here were really reasonable even though the food and prices were satisfactory based on the less cozy atmosphere I always choose.

We ate on the patio which is directly on central avenue and after the horrible smell of the grease exhaust pipes I couldn't wait to escape the place last year I was unknowingly taken back to this same place, years had passed and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return this time I was glad, it probably helps that going in my expectations were very low I was immediately drawn to the Mexican artwork kitsch, their extensive tequila collection on display and of course the Christmas lights, the salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice, they keep the salsa chips runny so be careful not to overfill the margaritas are really sweet but they are cheap and will get the job done, it's the kind of place where you stick to the basics, don't get fancy or try to order something healthy grab a shrimp enchiladas chimichanga burrito or a chili ellen and if that's appropriate get that miller style of enchilada make sure you have your belly at the ready when you're done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself the portions are huge and totally appropriate oh last tip don't get the guacamole it's super gringo and has a ton of sour cream I'm giving this place stars because it's good value for money if you share, their atmosphere is very comfortable, fun and the service is very accommodating",Good

8598,stars only because the house margarita and guacamole were so good the food was ok fish tacos however the atmosphere on the patio was a bit dull I understand it's more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no condiments and just cheap metal tables and chairs also there was no music there just this incessant hum of an alley generator the service was a bit sporadic on the patio also we were asked by three different servers if we had one server but not much organization maybe the management just hasn't managed to fully organize and furnish the patio yet. I hope they do as they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them a lot of potential.,Good
1484,"I tried several different kinds of pizza and they were all good. A few people had told me they made amazing pizzas, but I didn't really think they were very good pizzas. What I liked was the fresh tasting vegetables that topped some of the pizzas. The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I don't think you can really go wrong with the cheese, it just lacked flavor, overall I probably wouldn't go backlit, it really wasn't that impressive.",Good
6629,"first time ordering a squid salad that had a strong onion flavor and a weird taste being brought up on Vietnamese food, the strangest food has been in my mouth but I think this falls into the category of acquired tastes, I never took a liking to this pad thai, it was okay, the noodles were a bit over seasoned, felt like I should eat them with rice to tone down the flavor, the papaya salad was good looking of this authentic unwatered down version but just like my friend's mom makes it yum thai omelette good the people were really friendly too which helps but you know I'm all about the food I had to go and the box for the squid salad read happy carimali salad I love it",Good
6059,"I first visited Daily Dose about a year ago after a night out I was only able to stomach a little coffee and a few bites of breakfast nachos that morning so I wanted to come back for a real sober meal, alas they made a better impression on my first visit. to the front patio and a waiters station but I gave up my son knew he wanted a cheeseburger and I ultimately opted for the anchovy corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries yes it was going to be a cheat day our waitress seemed weird and lacking personality she didn't take our menus after we ordered and there was nowhere to put them on the small table so they ended up propped up against the window same thing with our cups in paper that we had brought from outside, they sat next to the menus for the entire meal, the wait as our meals were a bit long in my opinion, about a few minutes during that time our waitress was completely mia and our drinks were almost empty, luckily the guy who finally brought out our food was nice enough to refill them, so I thought the corned beef rubbed with anchor chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be bomb of spicy and tangy flavor, but not at all, what the hell do you do to the sauerkraut to make it bland, how do you make these delicious ingredients completely flat honestly, I was pissed, I wasted so many calories on this sandwich, I ate half of it because I was really hungry but didn't even bother to bring the other half home on a more positive note. The sweet potato fries were excellent, I felt unsatisfied. the tastiest part of the burger was delicious a few minutes after our food came out, the waitress finally came, I asked her for a box for my son's burger and the check she brought us at the speed of light. I was very surprised to find that I would be charged for a glass and a half of weak, lukewarm iced tea if I had known that I would have ordered a Hecate Light for the same price anyway, I had the distinct impression that she wanted us to leave so that her table could be re-seated with people drinking and rack up a larger bill for her loss, as I usually tip very generously when I go out with my son overall I was completely disappointed by the daily doses of food service and value and disappointed by my Yelp review which deserves only stars",Bad

8077,"I had very high expectations for the breakfast because many gave it stars which means as good as it may be boohoo according to yelp, my experience wasn't up to par but I'm willing to give them another try. This place used to be a bar that was converted into a breakfast restaurant. The current bar is still there with a flat screen in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty to the ceiling, they've only been there a few months so maybe that will change as they settle into the location, it has a very clean upscale feel. this is something that is not out of place in north Scottsdale, it is also easy to find once you are on Raintree then north straight it is on the right and shares a parking lot with Golds Gym which is easily visible from the road. I found the eggs good and I recommend heading towards the omelette choices from the south. covered in sausage gravy, the pancakes were not served hot with the other foods and they seemed to have settled and were a bit soft and springy. The menu was pretty simple and plain with divided boxes with a nice highlight of their stuffed apple crepe. I thought the description of the ham falling off the bone was repeated far too many times. Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale. The freshly squeezed orange juice was excellent. give it another try with your friends and family",Good

The bartenders didn't seem really eager to help us, which annoyed me a bit. lots of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as with the group of ladies that sat next to us nothing like treating all your tables the same eh we ordered an appetizer the yucca chips which had a decent flavor but were a bit burnt we ordered main courses which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs the wait for the food wasn't bad either but i hate it when you as a customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for a few minutes but the waiter didn't ask you if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the women's table next to us sharing an appetizer.

The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't actually on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem out of place, a little expensive, but nothing alarming. the sauces with stuff in theme had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork and one had chihuahua oh wait I think it was the cheese on top anyway the plate with tablespoons of sauce wasn't worth it, oh wait we got some the waitress also managed to slip us two orders of guacamole for a piece as for the starters the portions were small and the food was nice of me the mole was way too much sweet for my taste, the biggest disappointment of all was not the alcohol to match the appetizers it would have been much better if they had been washed down with frozen margaritas and a few pitchers and they could have slipped us some flan regardless of the price and the food was mediocre, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the wonderful assistants in Phoenix, I don't think I would go back for the food though",Bad

One of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy.

Anyway, breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash browns. In some places the service was also good but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us kids and calling me honey princess and honey.

What I noticed right away was that it has a sort of Eastwood feel to it and I thought ok, it was catering to people on their lunch breaks, but the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had truly Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better than the plates are statically nice with everything nicely arranged. well it amounted to nothing for me when I was able to eat, I want a lot of food and I want the quality that is expected from the type of establishment I eat at at Daphnes you get a few small thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat the falafel meat is kind of on fried discs, that's right, discs not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crispy and the inside is meaty and moist the pita bread is not it's just flatbread cut into little triangles, the tzatziki sauce is what that stuff is in that little paper cup, the vegetables were fresh, there's more to complain about this place but you get the picture, I think anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like",Very bad

942,"I am done with Classic Car Spa, their mediocre car washes and shady business partnerships whatever you do, do not have your windshield replaced by the auto glass shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I hold Classic Car Spa responsible for placing their customers near criminals, while these auto glass shop men are friendly and seem helpful. my insurance company they still give me a run for it so even if it was free I will now have to foot the bill to fix their crappy craftsmanship after trying in vain to get the auto glass store to fix my windshield. I spoke with the manager of the classic car spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed and uncaring attitude, this place is a joke except I'm not laughing.",Very bad
3362,"My favorite thing about this place is the decoration, it's crazy and beautiful. I also like that you can get better than average food until late and there are so many places to sit that you'll never have a problem waiting. Their food is okay but nothing spectacular. I lived in Arcadia and miss it every day if I had to go back to Phoenix Scottsdale I would never even consider a different neighborhood in every way. This is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricela County, that being said, the big one represents the lame element of the neighborhood. people with too much money and bad taste, I think someone else called it schmooze and that's exactly it, as a neighbor we usually rode bikes so I can't talk to the parking lot, don't they have the shuttle yet, give me the great escape, or messages any day",Bad

8183,"I wish I could rate negative stars with so many choices of bars, this place is by far the worst. Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friends birthday party in Scottsdale and decided that if we split up we would meet up at the end of the night at the engine boss's house, it was becoming increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they couldn't close up early. extremely agitated at our friend and asked him to put his drink down and leave, my friend started to explain the reason why he doesn't let his friends always in the bathroom, but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio at the two bouncers both visibly larger in height and weight, then my friend quickly stopped talking, grabbing my friend under the arms and starting to carry him as he was carried backwards, he lost his balance and fell with both bouncers on top of him, the bouncers slammed him head first onto the cement outside the establishment. The establishment pinned him with their elbows and hit him at that point. I ran behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off. I had already taken out my phone to call and quickly tried to take a photo to show that they were using excessive force. We asked to see the director. At that point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. the police arrived and took down the information about the bouncers and said they would record this incident. I am absolutely categorical in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever patronize locomotive customers again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close to go home or gain high power by manhandling the non-physical non-threatening patrons of their establishment based on the behavior of the two bouncers. I guess this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should behave. human rights and I intend to write to any regulatory agency I can think of, these people are giving a bad name to all bouncers who conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law",Very bad

Apparently towels are something you need to ask for because whoever owns this place needs a better manager at this establishment because they are losing money with all the one-time customers who will choose to go elsewhere next time.",Very bad
4109,"Me, I've Known Better pretty much sums up my experience here tonight, I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the perfect sushi place for people who either don't know anything about good sushi or have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket. I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived, I had never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go there was because it was close to my boyfriend's house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in terms of price and quality of food. My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and walked to an almost completely deserted restaurant, there were really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the TV. I sat in one of their ridiculously high bar chairs while my boyfriend went to get us a menu that we could peruse while we waited for our friends to arrive. Most uncomfortable chairs ever. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've ever been here you know what I mean, they clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided to get the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sunshine roll. a sun roll and a vegas roll, these two rolls and a drink were more than enough, we spent more than I like on sushi. I would be more than happy to pay these prices for a plate of delicious fish, but what came out was not what I expected for the price we paid. My rolls looked pretty but they were almost inedible. fresh salmon that was laid conservatively on top, I switched to the Anysun roll and it was a bit better but still lacked flavor and texture. The dashiki was just awful, it didn't taste like fish, it tasted almost like nothing and the texture was really weird. finish the plate, the staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be nice to us, but they weren't rude either, I'm saying this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like the only saving grace of this place is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another chance and try a few rolls before writing my review, but I was really disappointed with the food. I have trouble even using that word because it was barely edible. I ordered it wasn't the worst sushi. in the world but it wasn't the best at all and with the prices they charge for these lackluster buns I really don't see myself ever coming back here.",Bad

I was mistreated. I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about pool timings and the answer I received was are you a guest here followed by because we get a lot of people here so that answer is completely understandable. I should point out that I arrived an hour early with the same staff in the office, maybe it was me. this seems like a retype of self centered person but no i felt like the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my appearance i guess i just look like the guy who would crash in a hotel pool mind you this residence hall is adjacent to the mayo clinic and the desert yes the only two things within walking distance are this hotel and the hospital so apparently this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool accidents must be all the sick patients who want to swim in the pool then on the same occasion the same reception staff told me they don't have a bottle opener at the reception there is a small grocery store next to the reception that sells wine, beer, water, sodas and I bought a beer and I asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer near the fire pits and they said no it had been lost some time later. a little disappointed that the front desk staff was childish and rude to me, I felt like I was being individually discriminated against, it's a shame too because I love my Marriott rewards card, the rooms are big here, the elevator takes forever, I suggest the hotel adopt elevator music to distract from the slow speed of this elevator",Good

The bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was trying her best, nothing a little training and experience can't fix The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long, although being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars have to develop new and unique cocktails. as much as I could Tola had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and the Quest Chicken Tortilla Soup Cold Habanera Dip sweet with a quick kick after quite a bit of guacamole good but it was gone after the bites I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of shredded green lettuce it will seem like there is more than what was delivered. The white and dark meat chicken exploded Amanda offered to take it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry, I pushed hers to the side and meanwhile while we were experimenting with our starters we managed without cutlery or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender who managed to be inundated with specialty cocktails in the well thus not being able to properly supervise her customers at the bar. The crumpled black napkins used in place of the real ones were all in tatters on the edge of the bar, waiting impatiently for a bus boy to remove them from the starters. I ordered the carne asama steak, my girlfriend tried the chicken habanera platter which was delivered to them by Tola's manager Joe who decidedly opted out of enjoying the football match to speed up the food. and politely piled them up for our fictional busboygirl to remove properly now in my story with management a decent manager would offer to remove the crockery collection but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else because the look on our faces was disgusting. We opted instead to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with cutlery and napkins. the waiters who informed her that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some new customers so they could enjoy their increasingly cold food at this point my girlfriend's temper got the better of her and she jumped up and grabbed her own cutlery from a table in front of Joe and a waitress eager to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees we were digging into carne asama was tender but lacked the wow factor the habanera chicken tasted like a brisket of chicken smothered in their hot fire roasted salsa what happened to the habanera where is the heat bland i hope they get better but until then hands have never seen joe touch tables never offered to help a bartender who was swimming in an olympic sized pool every now and then the servers would come behind the bar and help us this is about the time our starters chips soups and starters were all taken out of the barton fri joe's stand the hostess can stand alone you don't have to stand there and maintain it, keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people are happy to come back and give you a second chance",Very bad

I was impressed also by the live music which was very enjoyable, we left feeling like it was an ok place that I liked better than my husband but something was wrong, maybe they are having an identity crisis, are they a wine bar or are they trying to have good food anyway, I definitely want to go back soon to try something else on the menu, if only for how nice this manager was to the waiter I worked in the industry and were treated like rubbish in the same situation, so well done, your staff looks happy",Good

398,bags is a great little place and I know that doesn't seem like a bad thing at least if you are the owner but it's a bit too busy for me I can never find a parking space or seat the sandwiches are good and I like them but I admit sometimes I don't go there just because of the crowds the food is good I like that they have a variety of sandwiches and they put a lot of stuff on the sandwiches that can easily be removed for picky people like me unlike others places where things are mixed in and not removable if you are looking for a tasteful sandwich this is a great place to visit if you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat to move around,Good

I just can't get past the price of their rolls and they don't taste much better than grocery store sushi. I will always go back for the teriyaki but not the sushi, it's just not worth it.",Good

4629,"note to others, check the zoo hours before going, apparently they close on a Saturday when the weather is nice, maybe that's an obvious closing time for everyone, but we were definitely disappointed, I guess there were a whole bunch of things we missed seeing and some of the other exhibits we saw were closed for a wedding, I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit or else the orangutans get married were marrying maybe those antigenic marriage people were right in that it would lead to animal marriages anyway, we all know that's not the case. Best of the zoos because it's very hot half the year and it's not very pleasant to subject a lot of animals to degrees but it's a pretty decent selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean and they have free parking. Damn I love me, free parking, learn more by pressing that button, things didn't work, at least one water fountain didn't work, but hey, it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine like most other zoos, they make you exit through the gift shop so your little ones can skip the car ride home. crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toys, a stuffed animal, I think if your kids are young enough you could probably just take them past the ticket window and check out the animals you can see under the bridge, the water, those ducks, fish and turtles are free to see and anyway, what age needs the whole menagerie",Good

8050,"no if you ask me about eating at papaya thai thats what i will say stars for the one staff member a little scattered and scruffy stars for the cook who can't prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes in this case i was left with two untried thai restaurants near the valley metro limo and both in tempe the other half was in tampa and since he doesn't care much for thai i have a chance to try some one. hooked me up with another limo on Broadway, traffic to get to McClintock took almost minutes getting out of the limo. I walked about half a block to the restaurant upon entering the restaurant. I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a slightly worried member of staff came to greet me. He asked me where I wanted to sit at a table with a bench facing directly onto the side of a huge fish truck. Contain people in the first three tables near the door, you have to do your business in spurts and keeping only the active tables works for you, but again you're telling me you're the only staff member, that doesn't surprise me. The help wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that help is needed when I was seated. The staff offered to bring water. Thai, I have already experienced the traditional Thai meal, everyone enjoys every dish served because of my proximity to the aquarium. I was pretty up close and personal with the fish. The water is probably not dirty, but the plexiglass tank doesn't help the perception. As the cell phone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour, I wait for water and a staff member who can take my order. he refilled my glass and asked if I was ready to order I said I was and ordered som tom the Thai name of the green papaya salad the staff replied that he did not know the Thai names of the menu items the phone rang again the staff's attention was no longer on me the phone his Pavlovian stimuli had taken him away I asked him if he had heard me he replied that he had to go answer the phone he Asked me if I minded waiting as he was the only staff member I said I would wait he left looking for electronic interaction, afternoon staff came back apologizing for the phone delay and asking me about my order. I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side. The staff took the order and went to the kitchen. The phone rang as he left the table. His pace quickened as he approached the phone. The door opens and potential customers enter, the bell rings and staff rush to the resistance to greet the new customers. which has no place in the salad, som tom has no cucumber shredded lettuce or cilantro when returning the original preparation the staff came back with the original preparation informing the chef said it was a traditional Thai presentation of the dish. I know I got up and left while the advert in the window of the establishment says they have the best curry in the valley, they won't get a second chance to prove it to me. Despite all the phone activity, no one came to pick up a takeout order between him and the somewhat frozen staff. I wonder if this place is a front for a drug trade.",Very bad
1505,"a little surprised by the high prices but I thought the trendy factor in the old town and the atmosphere was the reason because the small portions of the food and the quality is just good like good egg not great not bad just good no happy hour and too dark inside lots of pretty waiters my first suggestion would be to grill the may tacos and not beat them they were not that tasty the side dishes of street corn and potato chorizo were very good I wanted to try the guan but dollars for an avocado with garlic and cilantro, how about trying to make a good one, my husband and I thought the rubies are great in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the Pablo and Portobello tacos",Good
4829,"these were definitely stars and I'm rounding for a few reasons that I'll now elaborate on. The area could be in any sheraton anywhere in fact it is surprisingly similar to the rum fire the trendy restaurant at the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved into the family home the floor the red circular lounge the live music on Thursday night was all the same even the menu was the same the difference was that in Waikiki there was a Hawaiian side to everything and the live music was much better and good Sure, the beachfront setting, I feel like they're trying to sell themselves as a downtown restaurant more than a place in the Sheraton, but to be honest, it's your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant. the charm of a historic home but I also like the clean, modern lines we selected a few small plates or starters depending on which menu you are looking at the crab cakes were good if nothing less than predictable and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique a dill dip and french onion dip provided a nice departure from the usual spinach artichoke. price of the hotel, I think for me the area will remain just a place to have a drink and small bites. I'm not going to lose my mind over this place, it's not that great, I'd say it's pretty generic but the staff were friendly and it's within walking distance of my house, I'm sure I'll come back for a drink.",Good

I've been going there for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for drinks and karaoke. Food was ok. The drink specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation broke out at the bar, the staff did not respond quickly to notify the police. before and after the episode they said they hope it won't affect me not to come back, not even a return or something like that, just an I'm sorry for what happened, I won't come back at all, I looked at my nine charges on my statements and saw that I spent for their loss there",Bad

289,"I say I've been to the clubhouse several times a year for the last five years or so, does that make me the most knowledgeable person in the room, definitely not but there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here even though the artists were different genres, different crowds and even at different times of the year the sound quality is terrible. If the band isn't happy with their sound they will be very motivated to play, maybe this is a slight observation but it seems like the only bands that come back to this venue are the ones playing music where sound quality is, let's say, sacrificed or, just as importantly, metal hardcore thrasher hiphop, whatever you want to call it, the venue is also hot. great advice, the last show I saw here was in June, I know it's Phoenix in the summer, suck it, but when you leave the venue and it's visibly and much cooler than inside the venue we have problems. Can't they afford to run the air conditioning? The answer to this question may not be that the bar is understaffed and customers seem to be lining up all around, sometimes you have to spend money to make money. can sell more which means you will make more money which concept hates just destroying a business but I hope they take the feedback constructively until then remember if you ever wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a stocking format here is your chance if you ever wanted to give up wearing those pants I support you and lastly you should create a clever way to hide a vial as you will not be served although it may be difficult without stockings",Very bad

6587,"I don't understand, my husband, daughter and I went to eat at the restaurant because we saw a menu at the hotel we were staying at nearby. The menu mentioned that the show for drive-in diners and dives had done a show about the place and pointed out the menu items that were highlighted on the show and were supposed to be delicious. I knew how to direct someone to get there from the hotel after several times explaining the side streets and the name of the hotel we were staying at, explaining that we were just north of the highway and that we were about to give up. The girl was finally able to give me directions, it was an omen of things to come, the first irritation we encountered was waiting in line and trying to decide what we should order when there was only one cashier. a few questions about the menu, we feel like we have to hurry because of the eager looks from the cashiers, we ordered a variety of things for the three of us, the foot burger, the pulled pork sandwich, the onion rings, the sweet potato fries and the fresh beet salad, with the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would try something we liked, but the only adjective we could come up with for everything was blah, I'm not exaggerating, we were all starving and we're not picky eaters, but we just couldn't get a good bite of anything. Also, when I placed our order, I asked for add-on orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries, but the cashier called them full orders, which I didn't realize since my husband paid the bill without knowing it should have been cheaper. Our bill to us was equal to what we would pay in a restaurant with someone serving us. a few small pieces of grilled pepper and the base cheese, the burger was so plain I don't even remember if it had any greens on it, no, I would describe this burger as dry and blah, the onion rings had such a crispy exterior that it really hurt our mouths to bite into them, plus the onion pieces were so thin you could barely taste the onion, it was like eating a basket full of crispy fried breading, the potato fries soft and the white potato fries were also just blah. can you ruin fries after much thought we decided it must be the type of oil they were fried in it was just tasteless even salt and ketchup couldn't help these fries the pork sandwich was just ok as was the coleslaw there wasn't much to say about them. why the weird sweet and sour flavor combo, there is only one drink machine and condiment bar and it's outside so to refill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and wait in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything irritating. just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite in, we even tried to fix stuff by dipping our fries in B sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldn't fix it all, we left feeling ripped off, sworn to never come back and decided we deserved to stop for ice cream somewhere on the way back to the hotel to get that irritating sweet and sour dirt flavor of our mouth, pay attention to details would be my recommendation to the staff at this place because everything really adds up or take away from the dining experience, we were overcharged, irritated by the atmosphere created and the flies and we were still hungry when we left. I am submitting this review because I don't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the food network. show the hype like we were. The only reason I gave two stars is because I love the concept of farm fresh and wanted to give the place credit for that.",Bad

Its karaoke place is almost always extremely busy, leading to long wait times to sing, but that's okay because the people there are pretty friendly. is high on drugs, I wish they would do a better job of deporting these people.

3110,"on an evening stroll down Roosevelt Row during the monthly First Friday event I heard what could only be jazz funk coming out of the door right next to me and someone sitting in front of us invited to listen to their free music event once inside the wife's and I was greeted by the snack bar ladies asking if we wanted one of their cookies, candy or soda in the bottle we got a diet coke for a the nash a decent sized room with about four tables to sit at none of which are particularly better than another, the tables at the front being the only exception, the music was good if you like jazz music like me, but I think the band playing tonight put on a strangely slow paced set with more blues and experimental jazz than I would have liked to hear given how many people were coming out during their set. It was First Friday after all, this place could really use some cool and maybe even some gang. I guess music is subjective and changes event by event. I think they could really improve the quality of food, snacks and drinks. The venue seemed more aimed at a teenage crowd, especially since their food choices were chips, candy and no adult drinks in sight, although I don't see many teenagers running out to listen to a night of jazz, I could be wrong, but if I find someone worth listening to playing nash, I'll probably leave again. but I don't think I would randomly come over for a happy Yelping Phoenix jazz night, I can't get enough of this funky stuff",Good

I ordered the smashburger with everything and the smashfries. overall it was just ok, it's not a Lenny Burger, I prefer to go for the burger then the smashburger, the fries were crispy and flavored, they were good when I first saw them, I thought the portion was rather small but when I took it out of the box they came in it seemed like a normal portion, I won't avoid the place if people want to go there, I won't make a special trip",Good
6221,"a friend and I stopped here today for lunch, for some reason I thought it was a strange choice but seems to go there often and enjoy it. In fact, the woman taking the order told him not to stop by today, looks like he's famous in the Whataburger world. The people who work here are very friendly, if not a little disconnected. I ordered a Whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. but since it's onions, lettuce and tomatoes fall everywhere, the meat was dry and lacked any particular flavor, the onion rings were very generic and rather soggy.",Bad
7698,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night Saturday morning after seeing a show at Tempe Improvement. I arrived around midnight and the place wasn't very busy. The waitress was quite nice. near the kitchen and noticed a guy in the back washing a stool in a sink near where the food was prepared. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Mermaids anytime soon",Very bad
8301,"I tried my first quota burrito last night, I went with the Quest steak burrito, the burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans, topped with pickaxe and cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients. I've eaten many burritos, from taquerias to burrito chains, the quota falls somewhere in the middle. and we were in and out for our takeout order within minutes",Good
9751,"Heard a lot of good things about pets, I'm from the gulf coast and didn't expect to find anything that could compare to the delicious fried seafood back home, I'm glad I set my expectations. The pet fish is ok, square, almost like processed, but not strange, but the tasty fries taste decent like the typical oneida frozen fries. The onion rings were good, super fatty, although my biggest problem is that I'm a bit of a traditionalist. the red sauce is good with their fries and rounds and maybe shrimp but not on the fish, that's the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and I might go back if I'm ever in the area to try one. I wonder if they have mustard. Maybe they're trying to do too much here. the prices are very reasonable but they only accept cash. I would not make any effort to eat at pets again.",Bad
5063,"although I love the food here it seems like the service is really hit and miss a few nights ago and after waiting a few minutes for my food I was informed that they were out of what I ordered and then they were out of forks and fortune cookies, that being said when they have my order the food is still fresh and tasty the management seems to realize that there are issues as they provided free starters and such when we were not happy in Overall a decent place but we may have to start trying other places.",Good
6144,"my husband and I ate here for lunch as we were waiting for our room to be ready we arrived early the restaurant is very welcoming and I liked the decor we had a great window seat the view of the outdoor patio and the mountains in the background was lovely the hostess was very friendly and our server was attentive and quite friendly I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese with grilled chicken and it was quite good although I really liked it I would only give it to her because that they didn't use roasted beets believe they were the canned beets are still good but the roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park the salad had spinach sweet goat cheese tangerines red onion and delicious candied pecans with a balsamic vinaigrette it was a very good salad I wish I had ordered the small portion as it was a large salad my husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries the fries were so good the sandwich was just as good but spicy because of the roasted pablo that was on it netnet it was a very good lunch but I can only give it stars because it cost us a salad, a sandwich, a soda, I had a watering tip for lunch, it should have been exceptional, not just very good, I understand it's in a resort but still",Good

1882,"Lately I've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy, I'm not sure if this compulsion was driven by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring the famous Nola Po Boy joints or both, but it seems like the last few weekends I've found myself dreaming of that crusty bun topped with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise and fried golden Gulf shrimp. the po boy and I weren't sure when or if I would have the opportunity to return to the town and country mall any time in the near future, the inside was empty but they have a French quarteresque patio with a wrought iron fence and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. I'm a bit of a gumbo snob because I feel like I can make it better than any restaurant, but theirs was really good, they had different kinds which were good and it was seasoned perfectly, there wasn't a bite that didn't have meat in it. and the broth was just right, the prawns on the pb were succulent and almost tasted like they were breaded in a beige mixture as the fry was light and airy. I didn't indulge in any libations but they have Anita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area I'll probably return but this time I'm ordering a whole po boy.",Good
8526,"I love Chinese food and for such a big city I find Phoenix, or at least Scottsdale, lacking in options, either because they aren't the friendliest places or just because there aren't many of them compared to sushi restaurants. of enhances the flavor, I wasn't too hungry and decided to have the chicken fried rice. I have to say my favorite chicken fried rice is from Titties in Scottsdale which not only is delicious but always gives me leftovers for lunch the next day the portion was ok although the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either the service was disappointing as our food took about a few minutes but I have to say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get take out boxes as well as a coffee cup take out, I give it stars if after a handful of experiences I had peewee on my must-have list, but with pita jungle sacks metro ruby and nearby, the competition for fast casual is tough and pei wei just doesn't suit me unless I'm really craving Asian food that day",Good
6245,"this place was pretty good but I think they may have changed ownership recently over the last few months or so we have seen the food quality and service level drop to unacceptable levels.

1904,"I want to like this place because it's in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options here but it's probably the worst restaurant I ever had the misfortune of going to on my last trip. I sat down to order a beer at the bar. The bartender takes about five minutes to bring me a beer even though the bar is almost empty because he was too busy for me with his time and concentration, he instead spent flirting with one of the servers. I drink my beer and want another. The glass remains empty for about five minutes while he paces. the bar I try three times to get his attention and ask for another one the guy just ignores me at this point I guess they don't want my stuff and I'm just leaving he can have the pennies he owes me in exchange for a tip I just want to get out of here I feel bad when I leave he even got the pennies from me I hope he spends it well on other trips here my wife and I have had the food it's not any better than the service unfortunately i have an english bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and i'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable overall it's just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise the place always looks so dead in front of anyone because it's just horrible avoid at all costs i wouldn't eat here again but i would give the bar another chance if i heard replacing all the help which the owner of this place needs to clean the house looking at other reviews here I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service get rid of these people already just sad",Very bad
7943,"I went to this place for the first time the other night. The biggest advantage of this place is that it has its own parking lot with someone checking that you are there for the restaurant. The only thing I hate about downtown is parking on food. A basic dinner of Chicken Pork Fried Rice, Chow Mien and King Pay Chicken, it was ok, the Pork Fried Rice was basic and the Chow Mien was too gooey. the place is good for quick and cheap food, the staff was helpful and nice and the restaurant had a nice downtown vibe with a random birdcage in the middle overall I would try it again but I will try something different on the menu",Good
8437,"I just finished my friends meal that I ordered to go actually I just threw it away it was horrible and by horrible I mean shamefully bad and by shamefully bad I mean obnoxious I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would try again I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the more senior employees at the blockbuster next door what was good and to the person they all stuttered and didn't answer seriously zero out of four could give me a good dish I lived in both Mils Chicago and my ex was traveling to the Orient and we were always surprised at how poor the quality of Asian food was in that area and why people here seemed to like it, it's absolutely baffling. I had the orange beef spring rolls, the orange beef looked scared straight out of the container but when I ate it the texture was all off and the sauce it had was these big clear gelatinous ugh ugh ugh I can't even talk about it like biting into a scoop of cornstarch orange extract I'm still sick from those few bites really and while I ordered the vegetable spring rolls I got what had loquacity burger meat taste actually, i finally identified the flavor and texture as sausage, it was like an asian spring roll with pieces of italian sausage inside, how come for a combo, my stomach turns, i'm sorry, i'm a single parent and i'm usually grateful to have someone who cooks for me, grateful even when i pay, but in the hard times i treat myself and collapse for a yuck inedible it's totally unacceptable shame on you George for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall no wonder the place wasn't hopping on a Saturday night simply one of the worst meals ever",Very bad

5465,"when I heard about this place I was really excited because it's hard to find really vegetarian friendly food in Tempe, the atmosphere here is great and very sunny, it's in a strip mall which takes away a bit but the interior has a great feel. I still want to like the food but something goes wrong every time the black bean burger is good but it comes on an untasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart everything else is ok but why do they do that it's disgusting to put it on a bun like normal people",Bad

3541,"ciao is a really lovely place but I can't say I think it's amazing the atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star but too many things go wrong after that to give it an overall five star food. I've been there twice and both times I loved it but it wasn't a love, we had the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled. except they present the toppings in a strange way, for example if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza if you like zucchini everything is cut into two slices and so on, it doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way to me, I prefer draft beer to bottled beer and everything they offer is bottled. less than we had to wait so we tried to get a drink, the bartender was cool about getting our drinks on time despite being busy, our current server was super attentive at first then lost for a good portion of the time too, hit or miss, ciao is a lovely place with a great ambiance but it's not that great when it comes to food and service",Good

Phoenix was completely empty when I got closer to the hunting ground, there were more people and I realized there was a match going on. I didn't think I would be able to get in on Friday because of the game, but there weren't many people. the open tables overlook the ballpark, so basically you can watch the game for free as long as you order things. I thought it was pretty cool, as for the food, I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down, it was pretty bad, almost too mushy. Jimmy even came and talked to me for a little while, I will definitely come back here just for the view",Good

There are so many amazing Mexican dishes, but my only choices were a horrible tasting tamaletaco and enchiladas. How does a Mexican restaurant not offer burritos? the only food here worth eating is the baby churrs and sopapillas which were actually good, unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay so my wife and I could eat sopapillas, please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place, take your money to Taco Bell and get much better Mexican food at a fraction of the price",Very bad

8909,I love that walking through the doors of the sugar bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't like is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or there hasn't been any restoration work done since the day it opened let's be honest even though I didn't come here for the decor I came for the ice cream I was very excited when I saw the ice cream sundae covered in chocolate cherries and marshmallow cream I love the marshmallow creme and chocolate always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined well no luck they were out of marshmallow creme I got a brownie sundae instead I only ate half of it and decided it was only ok I probably won't go back to this place there are too many good dessert options but if my friends insisted I would probably oblige,Good

3133,"I have been back several times since the last review but the stand out was seeing take a trip it was great no complaints there Bar Smith although they failed on so many levels I got there between and and there was about a minute wait outside not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait for people to be lined up by the staircase waiting to go up there was a bouncer that didn't allow anyone on until people slowly figured out why they put the trip on the patio, I don't know, it's the size of a shoebox and was clearly at capacity before the afternoon. refunded, they clearly oversold the event and didn't think much of their customers who paid money to see this, they were going to put all the bodies in this place if it killed everyone else's demand after they finally went upstairs, there were so many bodies no one could move at all, it was total shit. I finally got to the back bar and waited in line for minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. down so forget about having to pee during the hours you are there if you had to go you better hold it otherwise you are waiting for another few minutes just to get back up at the time travel time the sound was low and slightly distorted. I walked to different parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night, luckily they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs, at least people could move around easier downstairs and the sound was better and the bathrooms were actually accessible even at the end of the night there were people queuing and waiting to go upstairs. Smith's bar has a huge f as far as I'm concerned, I won't come back to this place for a headliner, they obviously don't know how to run an event",Bad
1915,"I had every intention of giving this place a chance, mainly because it doesn't look like the kind of place people rave about after a meal, sometimes a snap judgment is entirely warranted. We were initially given a server who was not at all confident in his ability to perform his job even at the most basic level. When asked about the specialties, she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know what ingredients or sides were available. or God knows what she was going through that day and then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and all the servers in the place ran for the hills leaving the problem unanswered. If you have a baby who cries for love, take the poor little thing outside and solve the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen. We opted for a change of scenery in the restaurant after five minutes of incessant crying and were moved to the main area of ​​the restaurant and reassigned to a new server. earlier I finished reheating my coffee, I use that term loosely because it looked more like colored water before I glanced into the grill area that opens up to the entire restaurant to see that it was the nightmare. I saw a fairly large cooker with a tissue paper plug in the nose. Anyone who has ever had a bloody nose knows that it's one of the few things you can do to drain the running blood. visit this place again in the meantime, may I suggest food safety training",Bad

I found something to eat last night, I ate the teriyaki shrimp bowl with brown rice, the shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer, probably because it was, but the veggie rice and sauce were all pretty good. the concept is good, don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is.

I had the black bean burrito, the menu said the beans were slow simmered in garlic and onion seasonings, but it was like they walked by Safeway and bought a can of black beans. bean cheese burrito I like to have at least a small amount of cheese I guess their idea of ​​special cheese is magic the disappearing cheese the rice with corn a drizzle of cream was especially delicious the fresh squeezed lemonade was tangy perfectly sweet we also liked the decor the windowed kitchen for the price you pay for a very simple burrito that doesn't offer anything revolutionary their menu is overpriced I would rather go to baba Fresh or any other Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood",Bad
7523,"you know when you make a copy of the original and it's not quite the same, the edges are a bit fuzzy, not as sharp but usable, that's what I felt at the new market bistro location, the similar vibe that I enjoy in the original isn't quite as pulled together in this location maybe the lack of a seating area or the strange chic particle board tables or the fact that every table was dirty except for one near the main entrance to the blast furnace maybe the grease was dripping onto the glass in front of the grill no forks im sorry if i sound like a knock on mb but these are things that can be improved on the gentleman and i shared a salad and a cuban sandwich the control freak in me of course went for the salad it was probably the best salad made to date you should be able to patent your creations the sandwich Cuban was ok the ciabatta rolls are so thick and soft that when you take a bite the toppings come out of the back for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice like cardamom in it anyway the gentleman didn't like it at all it was his first time he didn't understand why I continued until he took a bite of my patent pending salad then it all made sense to him the salads are so filling and delicious.

The owner is still there and he never introduced himself or thanked him for coming back. The restaurant is just around the corner from our house but we look to other restaurants further away with a more welcoming atmosphere. For example, last night we went to the House of Tricks in Tempe. It was our th visit when we entered. Three of the employees greeted us and made us feel welcome.

I called the front desk to have someone bring towels, but as there was no one to cover the front desk we had to go get the towels ourselves. overnight at the much more expensive Hilton Resort down the street, not too bad.

9790,"I wanted to add a review to the company website but couldn't figure it out. I'm curious where all the testimonies come from. I have mixed feelings about my experience at the end. I think I ended up with nice windows even though my salesman was very engaging. I felt pretty confident in my decision to go with American vision windows. After this first experience, there was a communication problem regarding the planning of the measurement, but this was resolved fairly quickly. four days after that date when I called them to find out where my windows were, I was told they had just received them and could schedule my installation in weeks since I only had the Saturday installation available, which was understandable. The Friday before I moved in, they called to reschedule until the following weekend because the rain storm that had just hit that day had put them two days behind schedule again. given the delay I don't know what to say about the installation, there were two guys, one seemed to know what he was doing, the other I had less confidence in the work, it took hours to install Windows during the whole transaction, I was never told how long the installation would take, so I don't know if that was normal or not, the two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the whole installation, I believe the leader was joking with the other in him basically saying he sucked, I think the other guy was really getting angrier and angrier. Honestly, I was very uncomfortable being in my own house during the installation. I was a little disappointed with the cleanup of the job. I ended up having to clean the inside of the window tracks and window sills on the inside and brush the window sills on the outside. I don't think I should have had to do this before they left. I received a survey to review the entire installation process from the seller, I think this is a horrible practice that needs to be changed. is waiting for me and then I give it back to him, what this has caused me to do is exaggerate my review because I'm not going to give installers stars and give the paper back to the person I just reviewed. I can't say I would recommend this company, but I think the way the customer service went is really a coin toss on what you will get from any company. understand that when installing windows it is difficult to pay attention to the foliage under your feet, but I think an attempt not to trample the plants would be very appreciated, for example when washing windows I think an effort can be made not to stand directly over a plant and twist your foot back and forth.

6894,"this place is located right on the mill with a patio that is right in the action, they gimmick of this mostly college bar are their frozen drinks that are thrown around in squishy Klikemart style windows behind the bar that you can see, they come in lots of flavors like red green orange and seriously they all taste the same to me and after a few couples they only become recognizable by their color, the frozen drinks are loaded with sugar and always clear as octane high so it only takes two to feel super drunk and have a real bad stomach ache which is even worse the next day they also have regular beers and liquor and even a menu which I never realized until someone sitting next to me was presented with a burger at their table overall this isn't my style of fancy obnoxious comedy and I only end up here when someone else wants to go for a reason I can never understand",Bad

The location is right next to a smoke shop and gas station across from a mobile park. city side wobbly chairs wobbly table I ordered the chicken teriyaki I didn't think it would be bad I mean who can ruin teriyaki again with chicken fried rice how the hell can you ruin fried rice the chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed all day such a horrible taste the fried rice also tasted thawed somehow had a gross tangy aftertaste there were also no spices or of eggs in the fried rice just a bunch of onion greens which technically isn't fried rice, this meal may be related to something you get in the frozen section of a grocery store, they also give you a Snickerdoodle cookie which seemed like the best thing on the menu until I noticed it wasn't fully cooked, but the icing on the cake was pure, like gray hairs, which I found floating in my teriyaki sauce, so the meal expensive definitely wasn't worth it and I'm sure when diners were driving in and diving the food was great but today it was the most disgusting thing I've ever had",Very bad

We went there after watching a show at Herberger and I was expecting an upscale and expensive dinner, which is exactly what I got. The service matched the price, which was nice to see, but the restaurant itself was disappointing. totally, I had the drunk shrimp and they were pretty excellent, the sauce around them was really good and they sat on a piece of toast disguised as a crossing. I also took a few bites of the lava cake, but since it was buried under a pound of powdered sugar, I couldn't eat any more.

3718,"this is a huge improvement from the last bar that occupied this location, they obviously invested a few dollars in the renovation and added pool tables, the problem is when a band plays here they totally dominate the conversation and if the band sucks please install a smoker friendly patio right now.",Good

2537,"We received a coupon online to try this place and went on a Sunday around noon for dinner. The decoration is very cool. Flower stands with plastic covered beer taps on the stands, a stunning mural on the far right wall. We both enjoyed our margaritas which, for the size, were fair value. The food was tasty but not original. without as there aren't too many fat free or fish options on the menu, the crushed plantains and pumpkin seeds were a nice touch in the salad but it was missing something special that I can see coming here for happy hour or for a first drink in the evening, they had a prep stand which was cool but and I may sound old for saying this, it was just too strong for a Sunday night dinner",Bad
6231,"I was not impressed, the dressing tasted like a store bought bottled dressing and the tomatoes were very very mushy",Bad
4930,"last night Friday night was my first time back to Myst in years, the club is nice but the Friday night promoter is urban and not urban chic like a bit urban but I have to say it's a pretty mixed crowd, black and white Hispanic. the cover was and for rip which gets you upstairs, it's not worth it, it's a recession and the dance floor is downstairs, I'm not sure who it was but he was really good, it was like all the best Gucci Mane and all that southern type club music, really good stuff, I gave it a star rating, even though it's not a place a lot of my friends would want to go to looking forward that night it was a decent night if it's the crowd you're looking for, hey people I don't do much judging",Good
7036,ok they should be happy to figure out the flying virus that landed in my dessert and died before it was served yes i found it while eating the dessert it disgusted me but it's not necessarily their fault. The manager came over to apologize and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one anyway.,Good
1584,"I live a stone's throw from this Safeway and never end up here for groceries based on my experience if I haul my lazy ass to fries at Thomas and end up spending about less on my shopping trip than at this Safeway everything is ridiculously expensive even after the club card savings. I have no idea why it's because it's in Arcadia, is it the extra maintenance expense involved in overstocking the wine section or the fancy olive bar or the gourmet cheese selection or maybe it's the extra cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-checkouts, do I really have to queue for ten minutes behind a commuter with screaming kids just to buy a few sticks of outta and i understand carding, but do you really have to take out the book to copy my information and then make me sign my name three times because my year old signature doesn't match my yearly scribble, c'mon now that's excessive, i appreciate that you think i look young and crafty for my age, but i'd rather hit the crack pipe selling alcohol paloozas along mcdowell than deal with this nonsense, unless I desperately need an ingredient or need something special like their amazing selection of Mediterranean olives, I stay far, far away",Bad
4989,pretty good coffee nothing special but far better than Starbucks,Good
4908,"I loved the room and its functionality, but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face. I'm a young middle aged professional who likes to party and understands what the W brand offers, especially on the weekends during winning times, but when they do it on Saturday night it looks like it's shooting from your bathroom, it makes it difficult to stay. just a few rooms but it's a wrong number here",Good
7511,"I had a good bad experience at the Cadillac ranch the interior design was pretty cool and it had comfortable booths which I like we ordered three different entrees that were on happy hour before our entrees the wontons the quest dip and the chicken tenders the tenders were good they were beer battered and tender the quest dip was pretty bland and the chips were horrible they were not stale but obviously very poor quality the wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup it was like having desert and appetizers at the same time, when it came time to order appetizers I was the last one to do so so I asked my server for an option between three appetizers and she danced around them all, suggesting I have a pulled pork sandwich which was clearly cheaper than the rib steak or taco plate I inquired about. cover up the bad flavor my server Liz was awesome she was attentive and friendly she noticed I hadn't eaten my starter and took it away the manager came back and apologized he offered me another starter and I took lying advice and got the pulled pork sandwich it was much better the staff was good and did their job very well it's not their fault the quality of the food is so bad",Bad
3393,the burger was great but the service wasn't so good when I was thumbing through my wallet for money the owner rudely interrupted me and told me he doesn't accept cards only cash payment when my friend asked me what he would recommend he shoved a menu in his face and said I recommend looking at a menu.,Bad
834,"uhh, these are supposed to be carne fries because the boys think they are the best carne fries. I don't think the carne fries are boiled meat and the order is wrong. It's supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese on top of the meat, but they just threw the boiled carne asama on top of the sour cream. disappointment but I ate everything anyway because I'm that big",Bad
1746,the descent is not clean and the food is not what it used to be,Bad
89,"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high because I was really disappointed, very little shade was running out of water by the time I got there at noon, the other vendor obligations were out of food and by the time I ate everyone was already out of money for it I don't think so and when I mentioned it to the manager he was condescending invalidating and kept telling me what point the chefs were happy, I am your big consumer sorry devoured, I wish it could have been better what food I I tried, it was pretty good",Very bad
8992,great sushi not so good in speed cute place friendly staff try the vegetarian goya it's great the sushi rolls are a bit big for a bite asked if we wanted a tea refill as we were leaving eh,Good
5463,it's a japanese fast food restaurant i am very impressed with the service the owner spent some time greeting everyone i ordered a bowl of teriyaki beef but the teriyaki beef is a lie a bit overcooked and the smell of burnt beef just overwhelmed me the pinko breaded fish plate is one i recommend to try they also have the seaweed salad which i found good and they also charged for the soda refill,Good
6860,this was supposed to be my journey to have the best pizza in America so imagine my disappointment that they don't even serve it at lunch what human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner which I have since been kindly corrected by another assistant that this restaurant is not the pizzeria my group was confused since the waiter said they served a pizza dinner the focaccia soprassata sandwich was good but overpriced approx i don't live here to try it again so first impression is the only impression I'll leave it to all you greedy hipsters to improve the rating.,Good
2390,"what a lame store the employees didn't say hello to me once and were totally unhelpful, their dog food selection is ok but their dog toy selection is worse than foiled, shame too as good quality pet stores are hard to find, there must be something else here and I would go out of my way to find it",Bad
9968,"I've never been here before so I didn't know what to expect every time I heard the name duck jug I imagined a cute stop joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls, that's definitely not the case, I realized as I walked in, it's just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bricabrac, it's basically picnic stuff, I guess I don't know, it was really hard to get a feel for the place, it was pretty hit or miss for me, but anyway, about the food I ordered, the duckling sandwich was one of their signature sandwiches, it seemed like a good choice because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it, as did the name of the restaurant, but the sandwich was just okay, nothing special, not worth the money, just a few slices of meat between pieces of bread. my wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good, I will order it if I ever come back to this place, she ordered the sonoran with spicy oil vinegar, it was very tasty and no mayonnaise or any of the bad stuff, the service was very friendly but it took me a while to get our sandwiches, there must have been a big order in front of us or something because there weren't many people in the place, I couldn't imagine there go on a weekday during the lunch rush as the queue would probably be out the door and take forever to get your food, luckily for me I went on a hot Sunday afternoon",Good
8955,I would not recommend this place to anyone I went there looking for a gift I received no help the girl was too busy helping baseball players' wives I guess you need a big bank account to receive help at this store and they also didn't have a very good selection of items I think I will take my stuff to other stores that care about their customers,Very bad
4532,"I waited months to finally come here and it wasn't everything I had hoped for. I went for my birthday and had the garlic bread appetizer which wasn't very good and there were crumbs all over the table, it had a strange burnt taste. I had the mushroom and steak calzone which was huge and filling but very fatty and took a long time to get to the table. price, I probably won't come here again because some of my friends don't like this place",Good
5759,"I returned to the cork and experimented with the fall menu. I'm afraid my second experience wasn't good as my first, the service was wonderful at the restaurant, but the food didn't make me say yum yum with every bite, like on my first visit we had the risotto and neither of us really liked it. a desert to get real cork, I'm afraid this will be my last visit, there are too many choices like boys, asian fusion food, boys are more consistent and supportive and reasonably priced, sorry cork",Good
348,they have good baked baguettes and the price was last month but raising the price per roll during the holidays is ridiculous the cashier was short and unprofessional while I was waiting for the rolls she was rude to the next three customers spending the money they need to work on their customer service and I vowed to never go back,Bad
35,"I have eaten here a few times but none as bad as last night, the service was excellent and the very attentive food absolutely terrible. I expected them to serve steak on par with their seafood after all they were charging $$ for a Riley. What I was hoping for was a thick steak cooked Pittsburgh style, since I ordered what I received. no it definitely wasn't fresh besides the bad food we were crowded into a small room where we were crazy with other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who chose to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly started speaking English I have had it with this place if I had to pay money for dinner I will be at idiots or at maestro where the steaks are cooked to perfection and half does not end up on the plate in the form of fat and gristle",Very bad
3316,"I'm leaving this store angry and can't stop myself from writing a review, the staff is incredibly unhelpful, you can actually find someone to help you, the store is huge with very few signs to guide you so I'm still wandering aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped for even though I tell myself I'll never go back without someone to help me today, they were out of an item I bought last week and need more to finish my project. the lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she gave me her number and said can you call them, I stormed out, so angry and this time I promise to never go back there in the leisure lobby or Michael is worth a visit",Very bad
7622,they added roast chicken to their menu i love me roast chicken so i went to investigate i don't like their roast chicken to me it tasted rubbery and had a strange smell and it was so salty that an hour later i could still taste it i ordered a few pieces and ate some of it then i ran away i can't speak to anything else on the menu their garlic knots for what it's worth were good,Very bad
8809,I wish I could give this place a higher rating but my blow dry is terrible I asked for a bloody with lots of volume and curl it seemed like the cross between hold and cosmos would be perfect my hair is flatter than what I came in with my hair is curly naturally so has decent volume but for some reason it's flat also the stylist pulled my hair a lot during the blow dry and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated but I have never experienced with a bloody before i don't think i will come back sad as i love the concept and the salon is lovely update they offered me glowing makeup i decided to try the place again thinking it was a coincidence that my damn mistake was so horrible not only was my second bloody here poor i ended up paying for the service i wrote to their manager who had offered the free bloody but no response,Very bad
275,"thanks mobile yelp ape without you I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea where to get Thai food for lunch which was near a light rail station in tempe I arrived at thai rama around morning walking in there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff so I chose a table and sat down my waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a table sitting at the location of the seated table I had chosen as there were about tables available of various sizes I declined and told him I was comfortable where I was seated, there were other active tables in the restaurant so I didn't expect the restaurant to need my top before I was finished. The waitress put the lunch menu on the table and went to get a glass of water. the menu and directed me to the third page for the salads there first on the list som tom I ordered som tom the standard by which I measure every Thai restaurant spicy made my nose run made my forehead sweat and brought tears to my eyes leaving the green beans and shrimp and jasmine rice the waitress asked me if I wanted anything else to drink but I said I'd stick to water the ambiance here is quite simple and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality the decor reminded me of a formula restaurant like an apple seeds or chili peppers with a hispanic twist I watched the chef as he walked out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room as he passed. i needed something, i asked for more chili and lime, she came back quickly with red chili and lime slices, i tampered with the order and fell excitedly for the price, the adequate jasmine rice was about a cup and not too sticky, the waitress was good at keeping my glass of holland water in phoenix which is important to finish my lunch, i sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill, i didn't see anyone for about minutes then the chef came out of the kitchen and took another tour of the dining room in which he asked me in English if I enjoyed my salad, I replied in Thai that it wasn't spicy enough and I was surprised that he used red chili instead of Thai chili, he laughed and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress for it exceptional convenience for the next experience I will be sure the chef will see me before placing my order as the wait on the bill is a bit too long",Good
7101,"where I live in Tempe I can walk to the end of my street in an orbit that takes me to the main bus depot or drop me off closer to the Mill Ave light rail stop, not bad, in fact I like the clustering of a real bus depot away from a residential area with lots of security lighting and enough public space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. my bike here either the buses themselves are fine, I had some really bad times on the bus with the passengers, the first time I got on a Phoenix bus a knife fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report another time, two guys were reading hard core porn right in front of me but it's quite nice to mix with people rather than being in a cartoon, what I have a lot of problem with is that in most bus stations, I've had bums passed out dead on the seat met with a single no seat sign in the hot sun I'm looking for your seats in Scottsdale no shade around fights break out in the stations I try to call the subway they say it's not their problem they say it's not their problem they say it's the jurisdiction of the subway for this very bad situation alone I don't ride the bus at night because all the stations close to the art zone and downtown are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to arrive if they even stop for that, I'm grateful for the light rail for Phoenix night excursions, the metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I've seen in public transportation and cycling awareness over the last few years seem to be going on the right track",Good
9677,"while I am in no way a federal employee, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst eating at an airport restaurant, turns out the tavern wasn't as bad as all, the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight and the titular blue burrito, while not blue in any shape or form, was not too bad by fast food standards and pretty filling for what I spent on it and if you don't like it if you can cover it with cholula, close your eyes and pretend you're eating somewhere better",Bad
3037,"My wife raved about how luxurious it was, she said it was the best burger she had in the area. I finally went with her and was in no way overwhelmed. The burger was good but not the best I've ever had, the burger wasn't much better than something you could get at cheeseburger cheeseburger chilis red robin cheeseburger and in my opinion I think I would actually prefer a burger from those places to deluxe, maybe my expectations for this place and this burger were too high and I was disappointed with the end product, the sweet potato fries and the gravy were very good the service was excellent however limited seating and was basically rubbing shoulders with the person next to you because you are so tight the lighting in the bathroom is very dim, I'm shocked that techno wasn't playing when I walked in, I didn't like the hip nightclub vibe of this place",Good

7659,"I really want to rate the place higher, I like what it is about instead of tearing down the building and rebuilding something in this space it was converted into a community space. I went to see one of their cult classics and the staff was ok, it was a completely amateur hour, I guess that's ok for the type of movie and the problem was it was a sold out movie and the staff brought out folding chairs to sit in to watch, which would have been fine before the movie started, but they did it one at a time making noise for the first few minutes of the movie. the movie was whispering and then they kept getting up and down, their seats were pretty bad, their low seats reclined normally, that's ok, but there's usually a bit of spring, they had no support midway, my back hurt and I had to readjust, but there was no comfortable way to sit on the chairs.",Good

We met at the Prado the next morning for breakfast. hungry after a camel trek or a game of camel riding, I was a little disappointed with their breakfast menu, they had very little to choose from other than the breakfast buffet, I wasn't in the mood for buffet but it didn't seem like we had a choice, but I seemed to get the most out of my face after stuffing myself with a mini breakfast omelette burrito fruit yogurt parfait and our waiter made a bit of an act of disappearance but luckily we didn't need him much for the buffet, they have good food but could use more options and better service",Good

I'm not a picky eater, nor am I known for complaining about restaurant food or service. the place was already two for two, alas my husband begged me to go back one more time, he was craving oysters and as it's an oyster house I thought it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot, it was last Thursday night and the place was jumping this time the food was ok not good but decent enough where I might have given Casey Moors a fourth chance if I had been impressed with the service but the service was terrible our waitress brought us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another few minutes we sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop and although she quickly passed us several times she never even acknowledged us with a simple I'll be back with your orders when she arrived a few minutes later she asked if we were ready to order without even apologizing I'm not kidding when I say she acted like she didn't want anything to do with us she was very monotonous and never smiled with us, I would like to pass it off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables full of men with drinks she suddenly lit up, laughed and had a good time with them, it was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past, but no, it was the first time we were meeting her, we were pleasant customers who didn't complain about mediocre food or slow service, we were polite and left a good tip, we pride ourselves on being fun, engaging and polite to our servers since we go out often, but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry, we live so close to this place and would have loved to be regulars, it's such a shame that Casey Moors has now given us three good reasons not to never come back and I can't find any information on their website on how to contact the manager about this, so I find myself ranting here on yelp, a completely unsatisfied sigh",Very bad
3218,"well, let me start with a confused look at the overwhelmingly glowing reviews of this dining establishment, raising a left eyebrow and a smirk, but you already knew that first impressions were of a confused club type vibe with a bit of prideful haze. The music was the only positive part reminding me of the hatred of selling out New York. The servers seemed somewhat confused as we had servers at one point, but the bussers were excellent. the menu and associated prices quickly gave me a bad feeling, I'm too used to excellent sushi at reasonable prices as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites, especially the yumzoid dragon rolls, we then ordered a few starters and a handful of rolls none of which were memorable in a positive light. which tasted like breadcrumbs, the spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable and it was interesting to have tuna thrown in compared to the usual smoothie, the soft shell crab was weak and the spicy amberjack was spicy but quite off-putting and not satisfying. We decided to pay our bill then go straight to one of our favorite sushi restaurants to satisfy the sushi craving we definitely missed by hiring a sushi man, let me tell you I threw a back roll and a crazy roll and renting sushi was indeed the sushi hero of the day.",Bad

The food looked great, but then you took one bite and were disappointed. The salsa was lame, the fries were stale.

My partner is a sandwich lover so it was perfect. At first they didn't have many vegetarian options, which I found disappointing. they mean whole tomatoes on bread now, I'm ok with a few slices of tomatoes here or there, but giant, limp tomatoes looming over a few pieces of fresh basil and fresh mozzarella, so not appetizing, I ate what I could but wasn't impressed, my partner however made her own sandwich with turkey cheese and vegetables and she loved it. not very accessible for disabled people, I wouldn't plan to come here but if we were in the neighborhood I would pass by here",Good
6008,I recently attended a conference at a hotel and stayed at Squaw Peak. The grounds were very beautiful and with all the activities on site this hotel would be quite appealing to children given I don't have children and it was too cold to go out by the pool.

2342,"avoid these Einsteins at all costs, I stayed in bed throwing up for over hours because I ate at that dump because I know it was them, my daughter is lying next to me throwing up too and the only place we both ate together less than hours ago was there, the incompetent staff at this poorly functioning business can't tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and takes over minutes to make two identical sandwiches afterwards we came home and ate them fast forwarding hours and we were both throwing up. our brains are out, the most common reason this happens is when an employee doesn't wash their hands after being given feces, then they touch my food and I get sick according to the staff that day, it doesn't surprise me at all. I would recommend starving and never going here again. Now I'll go talk to Ralph on the big white phone some more.",Very bad

Partly, she then asked my mother: are you Chinese even though it was my mother who looked at me all perplexed because what does that mean? The lady then pointed to the seafood crepe section on the menu and said I don't know why but you Chinese really like this crepe, luckily my mother didn't hear what she said otherwise we had the spicy chicken lunch special, a bulgari and a beef yakisoba. The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini kimchi buffet bar with marinated tofu potato platters. bean sprouts kimchi broccoli and some other vegetables it also has this delicious house special hot sauce by the time we finished a dish of kimchi the food arrived so it didn't take long the spicy chicken came in a bowl the size of an instant noodle bowl but slightly deeper was tender with rice underneath the chicken was really well marinated but the last two pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat what a bad way to finish the bulgari also came in a bowl with rice under the beef was definitely not marinated the color was super light and the beef was almost tasteless, the biggest foodie disappointment was the beef yakisoba, the noodles taking up most of the styrofoam lunch box were sweet, then there was a glazed rice ball topped with chunks, I'm not kidding, three pieces of dogtags superbly meaty in the end, we just decided to take the barely touched yakisoba home for my youngster brother well teenagers tend to eat everything while my mom transferred the noodles to the plastic bowl from the styrofoam box didn't have a lid, I went to ask for a plastic lid, that's the best part, the same lady looked at me, pointed at the salad bar and said you can't take it home, I thought there was a miscommunication so I asked for a lid again for the noodles. noodles at home ok she hesitantly gave me a lid hey hey you we white people no stealing the kimchi started confucius saying no to stealing the kimchi only if I told her that to her face oh and when we got home my brother aka our dumpster took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again conclusion if you want amazing korean food and friendly customer service just go to choking choking is way better hands down",Very bad
6563,"Friendliest airport in Americas, really, I disagree, I haven't particularly noticed anyone being overly nice or particularly friendly to anyone else here, what I have noticed is that they have the same selection of mediocre and overpriced, we have a captive audience so we will offer them crap and charge them an arm and a leg for it.",Good

8283,"I don't know where to begin the official opening took place in September. We went to try this new dim sum place in Mekong Square as they were advertising it a lot in Chinese newspapers and were advertising it when I arrived. The biggest horror is that they tried to make their part of the food court into a regular Chinese restaurant, so imagine the image of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall, it looks too cheesy. I thought they should go for fast food type dim sum like in San. Gabriel California when checking in with the hostess they don't even give a number they only call you by your name so it was already quite different from the way a usual Chinese restaurant handles things totally inefficient at all once we finally got a seat things got worse our shrimp dumpling was raw the skin was thick and lumpy the shrimp was very undercooked we asked them to exchange it for another one and it was still raw, we also had to swap the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw, their excuse was they were too busy and did that. no time to fully cook the food ok how are other asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food which was probably the lamest excuse the brand beef internal organs which i always like to order was pathetic they charged the high price for a very small bowl it was only a few tendons and mostly filled with daikon the pork bun another staple of dim sum wasn't that good either it was almost no char in the bun and the outside of the bun was not fully cooked I understand it's their first weekend of operation but the idea of a cute Chinese place in a food court just doesn't work, in my opinion they even offer wedding banquets here too. I don't think I will come here again unless they really improve the quality of the food. The idea is definitely new but will be a difficult sell.",Very bad

2738,"it is unfair to rate this mall on what it was since it is no more and what it is is not as good as what it was, it is also unfair to rate this on what it will be as it is not yet today, it is a mall that I rarely visit other than a few stores that I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there is not much on offer compared to what it once had, the fantastic movie theater jutenhoops alpine ski keller bear blanket and even ed debevics are all long gone oops there I'm going to bring up the past seriously even though it was painful to lose them one by one so today there are linens and things which are hardly unique and a trader does which is nice to have in the area and also an attic and a cupboard of high end thrift store sisters which add some much needed flavor the chillies, booster and black angus are still there just like the jewelry store which never really offered a compelling reason to go in they stuck at the fitness here and they also added a preview and arbs all very healthy choices in addition to all the generic stores and restaurants and standard offerings there are still some unique experiences although nothing like it was crap I'm going back anyway so there are a few places that don't scream standard mall like pita grill a pipe and a tobacco store, you have to spell it that way in this case, a place to buy glasses and other uninspiring small businesses in that sense, I guess it's become a decent and convenient neighborhood mall, it's a real shame because it's missing most of the key elements that made it truly special, it's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie cutter malls that strategically litter the American landscape. I worry about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place one day, but I think the fact that this mall isn't that interesting in general anymore means it won't be missed so terribly when they lose this last piece of special.",Good

Our waitress was very friendly and negative, but alas it wasn't enough, we ordered damage rolls and a few sakes. bombersum but the shot glass was too big to fit in the glass which didn't work, the waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she had to take them out as they were prepared, we never got our messes, it took a few minutes before the first roll came out with no wasabi or ginger, the next rolls took additional minutes and the th roll took about a few minutes after the spicy yellowtail roll visibly turned, it smelled like bad fish which I unfortunately didn't realize until it was already made, it instantly felt sick to me and I haven't had it right since, meaning I haven't even had the chance to taste the roll because I didn't trust it anymore. She removed amberjack from our bill, which appears to be a breeder, but you never know these days. finally and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement, it's set up so that you're around other parties and you can't avoid being all in their positive koolaid at the moment, I'm still alive, which seems negative right now, but I hope this current wave of nausea is the last",Bad

Matthew told us they wouldn't fit in a bag, so my boyfriend said it was fine without a bag, but I knew they could bag one per box, so I asked for a large paper bag.

8653,"an hour that's how long we waited after ordering before deciding we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here an overwhelming and disappointing experience due to lack of service we arrived and found we had free valet parking with a small parking lot it works thanks a good selection of indoor and outdoor seating also a plus in terms of candor of waits taking care of waiting customers fail on a beautiful fall morning we came here but we are entered the rocker we asked to be reseated outside as the inside of the rocker is dark as a tomb and we had a loud conversation intrusive music we were reseated near the fireplace and a waiter came shortly to take our order, everything is fine for now so we thought after placing our order I ask another waiter to check the status of our food and he smartly asks what exactly we ordered. a few minutes later this guy comes back and says our order is almost ready and should only be a few more minutes soon after our server stops with comments of I don't know why it's taking so long and I put the ticket in right after taking your order son a waiter maybe it might be part of your job to check the status of an order saying after you bring it to the kitchen maybe what do you think fifteen A few minutes later we still hadn't of food and I had enough at the door, we went on a comical note as we were outside for another minute waiting because the valet had parked our car somewhere in Egypt or tandem, our server came to us to let us know our food was ready if we would like to come back inside, oh really, the clue delivery train will be visiting you shortly. we found i'm stunned at how good reviews they have there must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town because this shit would never fly where i live i can't tell you how much i look forward to never coming back here ps they own restaurants apparently richardson rokerij and dicks hideawayall right in the same area rokerij and richardson being attached pops they all serve the same menu it's not amazing I've been to dicks before yes it's good no my socks didn't come to steal the profits from the pops go down to central Phoenix and go to Durant Portland Switch or Fes all these places offer exemplary service and food",Very bad
796,"I had a smashburger for the first time a few days ago and I wasn't impressed, my burger was way too greasy, the smashfries were good but they were greasy too. I don't expect my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and fatty and they have gone into the land of fat and they have been heavy handed with the salt, unless I want my sodium intake for the week I would suggest they move away from salt, they are similar to five guys in that they don't have combos but they have more options, I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was passing a bad day, but between the grease and the salt I won't go back unless I have a death wish",Bad
5852,"ok so I get the peanut wood accented atmosphere, good service although sometimes rather in front and the dining room bar crowded even on a Thursday evening, what I don't get is the terrible food, this was my first and last visit to this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me. the appetizer as well and I was very disappointed with the batter and the two dipping sauces watery ranch and thousand island I really couldn't say that even a franchise like his makes them much better wow on the main course the baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something I have never had a potato that looked like it had been soaked in some type of brine then baked or something the color was grayish and the taste like that of a fish sea salt moving towards the broccoli I was greeted with a yellow looking lounge room presentation, I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or wow, the taste was again that of something really overcooked or underripe. The last chance for redemption came with the portion of rib eye steak which was medium sized and easily divided between the two of us, great wholesome beef taste and great texture only to be riddled with heavy saltiness. I don't know where this was picked up from, but maybe hanging out too close to the potato, I'm really normally a friendly restaurant patron, but after shelling out, including a tip for two for sharing food and getting served which we did well, you get my signed drift for never setting foot in the truck stop again",Bad
345,"I've been craving sushi regularly for about two weeks so I decided to try a new place, this place is right across the street from my work and the reviews here were a vote of confidence. I had shared the cherry blossom roll and the rainbow roll and the hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing but good. was pale yellowish brown in color and not as moist as it could have been the crumbled macadamia nuts were and an interesting and quite fun garnish the mess was tasty not overcooked but could have used a little more salt the green tea was steaming hot with the kind of nutty aftertaste you get from a good green tea I was disappointed that it came in a single glass not in a teapot diffuser with a cup of tea like in most restaurants my girlfriend had pork matsu the drizzled sauce was mild and vinegary but not too overwhelming considering she ate it all I guess it was pretty good the salad that came with it was a little strange the iceberg lettuce and a cream of sesame dressing the miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store but didn't taste homemade it wasn't too salty but the tofu had to be dehydrated it was in little little squares shriveled at the bottom of the bowl the staff was very attentive and friendly it wasn't too crowded when we went towards the afternoon the music was typical pop music but luckily unlike some places for example it's not loud I would say it's definitely not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in Arizona but it was ok the rainbow rolls in Kobe are better",Good
3203,"first of all, I'm a regular here on Sunday afternoons at Charlies, it's something like church to me in Arizona, cold spring beer, good friends, warm sun and boys playing volleyball in the backyard, although it bothers me to see so many of them playing barefoot in what amounts to an oversized ashtray, please keep your shoes on boys, it reminds me of playing volleyball in a huge litter box for cat. Charlies is not for gays who like to put on their tightest shirt, freeze their hair and act like they just saw someone. they know they can do anything except make eye contact with another human being it's for gays who are comfortable with themselves and enjoy talking to other gays who are sometimes cowboys sometimes drag queens but are almost always friendly even if they are a little tanky the little sunday pitchers have somewhat become a tradition and it's fun to watch the crooked people on weekend nights cons sometimes the crowd looks like the crowd at the rescue mission the Arizona smoking law doesn't apply to the covered patio out back so that makes it uncomfortable to breathe there and please take a cab if you've had too much to drink the cops are waiting to catch you later at night Overall it's a staple of gay nightlife in Phoenix, albeit a little tired, there are also branches in Chicago Denver and it was Vegas and it's always a surefire hit with straight sisters, brothers, kids and moms yes, I said moms who come from out of town, especially if they got twisted",Good
5191,"I have a new crush and it's pizza from Christopher's restaurants. I have been keeping a restaurantcom gift voucher purchased for use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it. I arrived with high expectations in terms of ambiance and food and was not very disappointed. The service was a little spotty at times. seated elsewhere but they were not seated at the food bar lounge or outside in fact it seemed they were the only ones in the room apart from the cooks in the open kitchen. The servers and bartenders bread was delivered but we were each given only a one inch slice of baguette, this is strange especially when the butter pot contained enough butter to spread on an entire loaf, never mind two of the three dinner courses which were relayed to us with the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish but when our server finally returned. about ten minutes later he asked me if we were ready to order so I had to remind him about the scallop dish, what was in it and how was it prepared and how much hmm maybe he was ready to go home came with mom so we had to try the calamari. I also chose the pizza with duck, candied goat cheese and figs for dessert, we had the profiteroles. the tentacles so these were soon finished at least half of the remaining pieces the sliced ​​bodies were undercooked value for money from the menu and I was charged on the ticket the pizza was awesome I loved the thin semolina crust and the duck confit gave the starter a great smoky flavor. the profiteroles were also fantastic, three slices of choux filled with dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla and chocolate ice cream were placed on a lovely display of chocolate panache and whole blackberry and blueberry crème anglice and a sliced ​​strawberry plus panache was poured on top of a profiterole during presentation. I asked if I could have more panache and our server quickly responded thank you. I tell you if I could lick the plate I would have a great happy dessert. I totally recommend the well reheated pizza, still as delicious in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered, can't wait to go back and try the other varieties happy hour use anyone",Good

3979,"Take into account the negative reviews, this restaurant can be summed up in two words mediocre, overpriced, I wish I had followed my instincts and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls attracted me, much to my disappointment, for a spring roll, although we luckily opted for happy hour and only paid for what was still too expensive in my opinion. nothing positive about the rolls I had the lemongrass chicken for dinner the chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were too sweet I couldn't detect even a hint of lemongrass the presentation was not appetizing with the overcooked chicken just slapped on the side of the noodles I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't mean to be negative but none of them commented positively on their food as I said watch out for the negative reviews if you like bland and overpriced food you might like this place but otherwise I don't see anyone coming back for more",Bad

2962,"betrayal, look it up, let me preface this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular place, but for every change I have had the misfortune of being dragged into, it is in fact the cheesecake factory of bad Chinese food with the downside of not being as capable of delivering passable food, they market themselves as an Asian dining experience, which is a bit ridiculous when they turn around and sell you their equally awful frozen starters straight up in the convenience of your local Walmart everything is bland, overcooked and ridiculously priced once you almost pay for their orange peel chicken you can privately hope they have the audacity to include fried rice this is your second mistake unfortunately the bistro calls you out on your bullshit you get white or brown rice is several dollars more and not worth the money at all everything seems to be cooked just wrongdoing that shouldn't be is overly juicy stuff that should be sauces are overly dry things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods while you find there is no way to escape the betrayal, things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper the change while having a vaguely asian sound is an all american creation it was founded by paul fleming in scottsdale actually with someone with some asian influence to spice it up a bit named philip chang they literally cut the poor bastards to make it fit better on the signs or as I like to believe, not scare flyovers from white states so it is highly Americanized and yes I have eaten Chinese food in China but I have also enjoyed good American Chinese food here to the point of being bland and regrettable and it is so expensive that you might find your credit score taking a hit after eating a plate of wok charred beef listed as one of the most expensive foods salty foods from America. The decoration is clunky and their famous inclusion of terracotta warriors are literally symbols of Jennifer Lee's death. The restaurant Jim said to me while showing the statues, it's not luck, it's something you put on a grave site, but in the United States they think it's a Chinese thing from the Chinese point of view of change, it's decorated with death, which is very good because everything there tastes of death anyway.",Very bad
2425,"I've been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the chance, the ambiance and service is great, but that wasn't the reason I was there. I was there for the food that many people loved. I read somewhere that hanging steak was their specialty and I don't disagree. the side orders were also nothing special and yes the fries were like everyone on yelp said they were good but just like the starters but cooked a little longer the side dishes were ok at best and were a little smaller however the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak so far while it is cheaper than the mastroscity hall I think for a few dollars more it is worth it to go to a better place in my opinion, the mastroscity hall has much better steaks and better side dishes but j g it has a better atmosphere",Good
3192,"I think the zips are fine, I remember perfectly well that it was the only decent restaurant near me in north Scottsdale so it was this or nothing, the food here is good although they messed up my order and put sour cream on the item but that's a common mistake anyway, I'm not really a sports fan and it was loud here which is normal so it's not particularly my taste but I found it to be made up of friendly people, which bumps it from star rating in my book",Good

I had rice noodle soup with fireballs, shrimp veggies and squid and my husband had a shredded pork sandwich, both were good and there was plenty of food, the pork sandwich was so cheap it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo, it's a subway anyway, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but if you don't mind the service was fast and we will definitely come back to this place, the People flocking during dinner hours can't beat the price.",Good

7775,"As I write this I'm waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop filling up and for the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled singing which puts me in a strange headspace even though this hotel is only three years old it looks like it might as well have been built in the s I can hear all the people's conversations in the hallway I can hear people walking in the hallway above mine and for the past two days the person's heavy footsteps above me woke me up well before my alarm Normally I'm pretty lenient with things like this, but this is a roadside haven aimed at business travelers and tourists, too stupid to see that this hotel is almost nothing. You try to visit Arizona so you can get some shut-eye. It's a little difficult in the current conditions, apart from you know, sleeping. The rest of this courtyard is quite pleasant. The interior and amenities more than make up for the absolute desolation outside. too small to handle the number of people who have to park inside anyway it's a newer yard. Marriott is radically trying to modernize its older chains to compete with Hilton and hates the lines of business. This renovation or new construction in this case includes the addition of a breakfast and dinner restaurant and a bar across the street open from ppm, thank goodness for both of these additions as the selection around the hotel is slim as a Calvin Klein model, I think there is a chipotle around the corner, I haven't seen you jump for joy, which is not impressed, the rooms are modern courtyard style with flat screens, shampoos sophisticated, interesting artwork on the walls, wired and wireless internet, etc. this place has low tiled showers with glass doors, I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor since it's all fabric anyway if they could fix the sound issues, luckily I'm on the side of the hotel that doesn't face the highway, I easily give another star the proximity to anything worth having is pretty bad, but the purpose of this hotel seems to be to house workers in the local warehouses nearby, there are plenty of regulars here week after week, as the bartender told me a few nights ago, a definite draw is that their workout room is top notch and sure, dead, you can easily be the only one there night after night while people who really need to use a gym will walk by you with their minds on beer looking out the window as if to ask why anyone would try to get rid of the food they're eating hmm, I wonder that the interior of this courtyard more than compensates for the desolation",Good
8014,"good salad options, it's really hard to mess up the lettuce and veggies as for the rest of the selection we must have just come from a bad night the pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to the dense selection of fresh fruit only fruit, not exactly a huge choice if you want a good salad this is definitely the place to go",Good

I will definitely take my clothes elsewhere. First of all, the service took way too long. compared to the shirts the attitude of the staff is quite compensatory and it makes it seem like such a task but they fixed the girl working near the fitting rooms was very friendly and helpful I don't want to sound like a hater but as I was quite a loyal customer it was quite disappointing especially in this economic crisis where customer service has never been more important than for those working in retail.",Bad

Additionally, the classes don't teach you to think critically, which I think is crucial in college. Don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. get me into the classes I need the advisors are walking business school advertisements they aren't knowledgeable enough to inform you I got kicked out of two required prerequisite courses so I couldn't move on to the next level even after preregistration I got screwed and ended up having to take an extra semester to graduate tuition went from one semester in the fall to in the fall one thing I loved was the student theater performances admission was reasonable and quite entertaining the college of architecture and environmental design the studios are pretty good and have good security like it's not the safest neighborhood I was approached by a lot of shady people don't live on campus especially the dorms on north campus they are beyond crap and overpriced you have to share your room with a roommate in most cases for undergrads the first year experience is bullshit they are pulling you, don't buy it and please, please don't move into many Manzanita stores with triangular windows. place yourself on campus again, don't bother wasting your money, especially if you are a foreign or international student, hope this helps you",Very bad

They had a lot of local Japanese restaurants selling dishes such as Nagasaki Grill Paradise Be and Arabic Pastry which was nice, but I'm close enough to all of these restaurants that I could purchase their selections at any time at their restaurants. I think I was overly spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco because the food selection here was more limited and there weren't as many stalls to buy things. I liked the cultural performances such as the taino and martial arts demonstrations and the shaded area with the bonsai and akita was nice, I think in general if you don't live near Japanese restaurants or don't have a lot of immersion in Japanese culture it's a good way to introduce yourself to it here in Arizona.",Good

6624,"torn mango slices add an extra dimension to a traditional papaya salad dish, the original typical traditional Lao papaya salad is garlicky, lemony, sour and peppery, varied, the way this dish was prepared lacked all of these characteristics, but the substitution with ripe mangoes solved this problem and gave it the flavor it needed by design. I expected that to be the intention of this Americanized dish. different for a change the mostly non-minority American diners would enjoy the papaya salad is generally considered an appetizer a feminine dish usually prepared by a woman is also blasphemous to a male cook and I don't want to know but it's the best dish I've had at this place the others were pad thai and a mix of chicken with broccoli both tasted very Americanized the pad thai is reminiscent of a takeaway from the panda not bad but not special overall in its Americanized Thai design that attempts to tone up the flavors of the dish and the way the ingredients are prepared, this creates a different twist to traditional dishes because for example you can't throw canned fish sauce into these dishes like you would in an authentic Thai restaurant which would smoke the whole place up in my opinion. the place is remarkable, both of these factors outweighed the dining experience, parking can be a walk since you are in old town Scottsdale depending on individual preferences looking at the food alone, it would not be a place I would come to repeatedly, it does not offer traditional flavors in the sense that lao thai, thai sean or thai hut do for the same price nor does it expect one to follow traditional food etiquette which is the essence of the food of this region, but it would be a place where I take those who cannot stand the traditional flavors. we should eat a little before coming here",Good

The menu size has decreased significantly, which is understandable. The menu of long songs was way too big. They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day. I happily take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old, let alone even at lunchtime, it's not uncommon to have a pretty old slice anyway, the burgers are better than McDonald's but really not that good. they aren't normally like that but I was horrified and didn't try another one, the owner is impatient and you can tell he's really trying to keep the business going but the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes. I heard snotty voices saying they didn't have slices when I tried to order a slice of pizza during off-peak hours and was denied a simple refill of my soda when my order took much longer than expected, which said I haven't been there for a few months so maybe that has changed.",Bad

It seems the service has declined with each change of ownership. Today was the tip of the iceberg and I won't go back. I started with their window repair salesmen I still get the premium car wash a few weeks ago I went there and when I got home I noticed they hadn't cleaned my dash or center console which is included in the premium. I also noticed that they didn't wipe down my tires after applying armor and it all splattered on the sides of my vehicle after leaving, I chalked it up to just a mistake and that it probably wouldn't happen again today, the experience was worse. upswell, I was then pressured to buy it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No, that wasn't a response to that guy. I had to step away to leave this wave of pressure again. I purchased the premium cleaner they requested for the vehicle and noticed there were little black spots of mud all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about it and he said it was ready. and told me he had to go get a clean rag, I asked a manager, the manager came and asked the guy to wipe the stains, but he didn't seem to care at all and left before the guy wiped off half the stains. I had already tipped the first guy and this guy was there, waiting for a tip. due to my dog ​​leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair everywhere, I had an oil change at Danny Car Wash at the Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago and was so impressed with their service and car wash service that I will make the one minute trip to go there for my car wash from now on",Bad

I loved them both, but the margarita had more flavor and I preferred it to the pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.

I admit to being a bit picky, but during my months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings. Thai Hut in Central Phoenix So far, the Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally a few steps from my office and other helpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on the Thai Elephant without giving it another chance on Friday looking forward to a relaxing night at home. I pulled out ridiculously oversized portions of all three entrees and sat down to enjoy my feast wow I'm not sure where to start but saying I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it the pad thai was about on par with the taste of the Thai boxed dinners you can buy at the grocery store only less tasty, marginal at best but edible the chicken wasn't notable for being particularly bad in quality but the noodles were some of the worst I've had in a thai restaurant some bites were undercooked to the point of being crispy while others were seriously soggy unfortunately the mediocre pad thai was by far the highlight of the meal the spicy eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy overcooked vegetables and limp tofu the tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block then sliced and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure the penang curry with beef was even worse although I ordered the spicy dish the curry tasted like pure coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown into the beef was the final straw for me, it was possibly the dirtiest and worst quality meat I have ever eaten in any restaurant I have been to.

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said Murphy wasn't quite up to par. We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty but they were a little cold for something that is labeled as a sampler. as it seems you can buy them in the meat section of any supermarket, the sausages were served with three types of condiments: mild mustard, Dijon mustard and ketchup mixed with curry which, I was told, is a recent favorite of German children brought over from Turkish immigrants for our starters. my friend's blandest schnitzels had different toppings sauces and stuff and my poor little sausage schnitzel was just bland and all by itself you have to wet that sausage schnitzel with sauce no big deal I'm a foodie so I'll eat it a schnitzel is basically German country fried pork not super exciting I copied my friend who lived in Germany and replaced the potatoes on the side with spaetzle because I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible, I don't know if it's just Murphy's but the spaetzle was a bit bland even with the sauce, I do however like the word spaetzle if I had ever visited Germany I would only say spaetzle to everyone, I also liked the other thing that was served with the starter, it was a bit like mashed potatoes mixed with cream sauce, onions and some sort of vegetable green or herb, probably spinach, the beer here was a good authentic German beer, I didn't get drunk but I still don't remember what type I had, you'll have to. the experience service was excellent I read reviews that said Murphy was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us the waitress was very friendly and they spoke very good German not that I speak German but it looked sexy she was very helpful in describing everything from the food to the beer I ordered a big ass pretzel to go Philly is known for very good pretzels and this bap was good it was expensive but it came out hot and soft the only thing is that they went a little heavy on the salt to steal and edit a quote from a seinfeld episode that the big ass pretzel made me thirsty, note they don't actually have it on the menu, would I go back to Murphy's eh yeah to try some of the other things but I definitely can't see it as a place I would be a regular",Good

Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio there were chairs and miscellaneous items outside the restaurant and it needs some tic chips, the flour is good but the salsa has black olives yuck personal preference and the hot stuff tasted like vinegar in it, there is a great patio for day drinking overall the food is above average I ordered the fish tacos and they were good, my partner in crime ordered a combo with your typical rice bean enchilada taco and the food was hot and good, there was no wow factor but the price was good and worth the money, the service was terrible, I'm not going to name names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service, I hope they don't correlate but they usually do with aunt. you're better than that if you live in the area then it's worth going I probably won't make the trip again good luck aunt child",Good

I'm used to Korean restaurants in many Angels and I can say that this place can't compete with those restaurants. At first they didn't seem to have the right ventilation for Korean. I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their tables. for our water or for someone to acknowledge our presence, the food was ok but the seafood crepe was super disappointing, they didn't even seriously chop the scallions they put in it like whole stalks of scallion and there was no seasoning.

I've also had dishes with their baba sauce which tends to be too heavy for me.,Bad

662,"this place could be awesome and I've always wanted to like it more than I do from time to time I stopped at Mills End for breakfast, especially because they have pancakes on the menu. In fact, their breakfast menu is actually quite extensive for a small cafe for reasons explained below. can make a cafe stand out from its competitors, it is with these three elements that Mills End does not cater to ambiance, this means that the environment must be suitable for both studying, reading and relaxing, therefore music must be something that is non-inclusive and that customers can generally ignore. by the way what's up with the pseudosexual ice cream photography on the walls, that's actually my number one problem with the grinders, the coffee is reasonably priced but the food is overpriced every time I tell someone I ate there it's always the same response yeah their food is good but it's really expensive considering this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop. I imagine their business has increased but those prices certainly haven't gone down. smiling like idiots all the time, I just want to feel welcomed with a little hospitality, that has always been lacking in Mills End, honestly I think this place has a lot of potential but it seems awash in complacency",Bad

The service was excellent, as was the food. I had pizza and if you like thin, crispy crust you will also enjoy the pizza. The music was a little loud for a Sunday dinner, especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. I'll probably go back during the week so I can get a taste of what it's like when it's busy. overall decent meal",Good

I had duck red curry and wasn't very impressed at all. i gulped down my already bland curry sauce as the water from the vegetables moved around the plate plus the curry lacked flavor the vegetables really needed a boost too they should have been sautéed or served with some sort of sauce the service was ok but not great there was only one other table in there and the waitress seemed to forget things and when we asked her about the meals it felt like she was giving us canned answers that everything was fine, just ordered something so I could go home, granted it was about or a few minutes before closing so maybe that had something to do with it, it wasn't a bad meal by any means, it served the purpose of providing food and it was better than bringing Mickey back to the hotel room but I won't go into the definition of stars, that's me, I've had better and I think that description fits my meal perfectly",Bad

I like the shrimp to be okay, a little rubbery, but then what can you expect for a seafood restaurant in the middle of a desert. My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food, it's just too expensive for the amount of frozen food dumped in a fryer. cheaper, I just wish it wasn't so expensive, especially considering this in the neighborhood, if you know what I mean, I don't mind going down to the neighborhood for fried fish, but only if the price is reasonable.",Good

Yes it's that close and yes it's a presumed venue so I should have expected the club to be filled with something but just because I'm looking doesn't mean my internal reality made me feel a little left out but I was like whatever this is it's kind of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be a club. to be ego, it didn't work for me, it felt like I was in someone's basement transformed into a rock haven, black walls, random decor and a single stinky quasi-couch that looked like it was salvaged from a landfill. The stage was at the front of the club and the bar in the middle dissected the crowd of the more drunken ones. Unfortunately if you wanted to drink you had to stand on the other side of the bar which was rubbish because you barely had a view of the stage so you wouldn't pay. lushes have a better view than the young people who only paid to get into the club, stupid, I have to say although the sound system was way better than some of the other small music venues I've been to it's a plus, ultimately this latest annoyance will definitely show my age but having to stand the whole time I was there was horrible, my feet hurt dammit and I just wanted to sit down but I'll suck it up next time because there's very good bands playing here and for me good music can make any situation better.",Good

The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality. indescribable it was straight from a bag of mozzarella that was congealed in a huge mass of fat the pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings that I couldn't even identify the crust it was disintegrating before my eyes the prosciutto was all in one big bunch instead of sprinkled everywhere so disappointing my friends don't care the salad was mostly a plate of tomatoes with a cheese topping and a sprig of basil I love a good one care and I especially appreciate it when there's a fairly equal amount of all the ingredients helps balance each bite, you know, no luck with this one, our service was pretty helpful at first, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food she just tried to get by with minimal interaction. a great vibe of layout, I hope they solve these pretty big problems and become the kind of place I'd like to revisit",Bad

I give stars other stuff, no alcohol cuff, I said greasy chips as a side which was a bit disappointing.

9112,I went here about two months ago and am just starting to review it. I think that should represent something in terms of my experience there. The service was ridiculous if you want to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized Asian food. At least make sure the menus you give people are clean or your plates or cutlery are seriously anything should be covered in grit or some mysterious sticky substance next to the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choice for those of us who prefer tofu to dead animal? the veggies bland bland I got more flavor from a packet of unseasoned ramen and would it kill them to put tofu on the plate I guess I just don't understand the hype the prices are ridiculous for the quality received you're better off going to a little hole in the wall where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers,Bad

The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and it doesn't seem to matter how often you let management know. outside the patio that you make them dine with you or at least it makes you incredibly uncomfortable On our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless people were parked.

What I wanted to sew were two small pom poms attached to the fabric strap that were loose and I wanted them sewn tighter, not a difficult task. She then told me that maybe she could send it in and have it sewn. but it would take me a week or more to get it back, which I then asked her about the skirt I wanted cleaned, pressed with the tags attached because I'm selling it, she said no, that the tags would be destroyed in the process, so I went to another dry cleaner and asked for the same things for the skirt and bag.

I actually tried every pasta dish on the menu. why do all these helpers love pasta it's disgusting and the protein tastes almost boiled the texture and flavor approves of a guest's quote handmade gummy pasta that looks like a playboy swollen in water the sauces seem almost amateur like they've never been tasted before serving usually on the savory side forget the portions price space ambiance whatever the important question does it taste good unfortunately no on every visit I brought other notable valley chefs in one case the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish asked for the bill and decided to head to Sens for dinner, which is another review in the making. I will wait until fall before returning to the pasta bar, maybe it needs more time, although it has already been open for a few months, as always I encourage you to try it and make your own decision.

There's a balance in my account, huh, number one, I don't have an account at the hotel and number two, I haven't spent the night here yet, I'm just sitting there thinking what's happening is he's getting mixed up with someone else. Finally, he explained to me that parking was not prepaid and that I had to pay to get my car. this confusion could have been avoided if the valet had simply said you pay at the desk instead of paying it up front, which is unclear and indirect.

One later remarked that it was the only time in his life that he spat out food in disgust while this was happening. his reaction suggested we were crazy for asking such a ridiculous question.

I ordered the large Parisian salad and a soda. cabbage bomb in a plastic clamshell oh my soda was a nice styrofoam cup that I filled on the fountain machine all for about the cost of the food couldn't have been any more than even if purchased at Costco next door I was definitely not paying for the lame ambiance a few people there got packaging that looked gaunt and a general poor excuse for packaging that I would like to pay money for at a restaurant I could make the same lame roll at home for about as this place is simply another ticking firebomb of another failed independent restaurant if the owners take a risk and venture into being more than gas station food they might have a prayer",Bad

However, if you want Italian food you won't get it here, it's a very Americanized version of Italian food, they have all the classics, pasta, lasagna and me. i have been here a few times and tried a few of their dishes spaghetti vesuvius cute name to start spicy chicken sausage and mushroom meatballs i didn't think it was that spicy but it was very salty it is a very tasty dish however the individual tastes are all mashed together the noodles are a little hard for me maybe not cooked enough but some people like it a little hard gourmet giant crab ravioli there are not many pieces of ravioli in the dish the edges that weren't covered in pesto alfredo sauce were dry, I liked that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli, the creamy sauce wasn't bad and it wasn't too strong in my mouth, I could taste the pesto sauce while still enjoying the texture of the baked crab lasagna, it's the best I've had, it has some kinds of cheese, some ground beef and pork. were cooked quite tender for my liking but they were still able to hold their shape and the meat was well blended with all the flavors of the dish. I love the cute little portion of spumoni ice cream. It's a great mix of pistachio chocolate and strawberry and is just what you need after a big meal.

By the way, we were asked before if we wanted anything else to drink, you didn't guess it anywhere, we never asked how our dinner was, you guessed it no now, you're probably saying why didn't you do something about it, we would have loved it, but there was no one peanut, even someone to refill our water glasses, only after we finished with our sad cold starters and piled up all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table. upon his return we presented him with the discount Brio had sent us for being frequent customers, he took it and never came back after sitting there at an empty table, empty glasses of water and nothing to look at but the crumbs left from the wonderful flatbread we placed in cash on the table and left to try to salvage our evening on the way out. Glenn finally located a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a very long time before we tried Brio again. our evening so he could have done something good, maybe if he walked around the floor instead of hanging out with the ever so cute hostess he knew, do we still love brioyesare, we are extremely disappointed with our service last night",Good

I couldn't even eat them, the two racks of fish I had were fine, but I might as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of gorgonian fish sticks with the special red sauce and you have to pay extra if you want a lame tarter, not enough malt vinegar, I said why there is such collective forgiveness for this place is beyond me, this is a ridiculously bad example of fish and chips",Bad

3952,"I have been to Jade Spirit several times and Kim really does a great job and he has helped me a lot but the problem is the receptionist she is the kids wife and she is very forceful about sharing her crazy sexist opinions and boy can she talk and talk and talk it makes the whole experience stressful and not worth going there on the first visit she gave me this booklet asking patients to be quiet and respect the peaceful place it is supposed to be, but when I'm in the middle of my treatment, I can hear it going on and on. and it encourages patients to go ahead and speak as loudly as they want, so it's not as restful as it should be. This is not an appropriate place for her to socialize, especially if she is trying to impose her views on customers who are there to see her husband. Kim is amazing but doesn't bring in enough for me to be willing to deal with his wife.",Bad
3367,"I like it spicy, I mean I like sweating from the bridge of my nose when I eat when they asked me how hot I wanted my chicken green curry, I did a double take, it's not a spicy green curry by definition, they told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the crowd, while I don't agree with the dilution of the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it, they have a business to run, which I really don't like it, this is how they do it, they make a mild green currier with no green sauce, then when ordering they add a certain amount of red chili pepper. flakes depending on how spicy you want it, not only is it philosophically upsetting, but chili flakes need time to cook into a curry, you don't just mix them and serve them. I have a feeling this problem is rampant in Arizona, I hope to find a solution soon",Bad
1023,do to have that review you keep putting it off and don't bother writing that the post office for me you get what you get and you get it here it's like a review of a place that no matter what any of us write I'll never change one thing I love to see especially once the snow birds come back a quick line just a baseline for basic transactions I still use the automatic machines as often as I can but it always seems like the times I have to wait in line it's always at the door and it takes forever to stick to mornings and late afternoons skipping weekends,Good

I tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt and a small black cherry cheesecake sundae, the sundae was by far my favorite. I like the simplicity, the berries weren't too sweet, strangely artificially thickened, the malt was nice. and malty which I really enjoyed and was quite thick even after melting slightly now the cement mixer was the richest of the rich maybe because I decided to go for a cheesecake flavor to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor, it was very tangy like cream cheese about as tangy as a good Greek yogurt with little bits of graham crumbs swirled around and of course the blackberry flavor",Good

This employee couldn't help us either because he had never seen anything like this and he didn't know he wanted to have anything to do with something that had a power of attorney. I guess we are one of the first people here to sell a house while we were waiting for this man to do something.

I am so disappointed I bought turkey breasts there for a breast, I came home, froze two and cooked one, it smelled but my husband insisted it was the smoky smell from being in the butcher case with all the other meats. I trusted his opinion and cooked it by cutting it for dinner. I found the free range turkey to be very fatty, it was disgusting but no one got sick, luckily now I just defrosted another one and the same thing but worse it stinks like the dead rotting animal, it's really bad and it gets even worse when I inspected it and opened both breasts. the stuff is everything is gray and rotten, they stuff their turkey breasts with junk to make more money, i've had it with them, i'm not surprised they've always been in trouble, frankly, the manager, he's really not the type of guy you could trust with food, he's kind of scary and gives off a dirty attitude, i don't care, i spent there on whole ground turkey and he still charged me the sternums and another employee told me they usually throw them in the trash. it cannot be trusted and it has failed every time it really is the highest price for the highest waste. My husband thinks the manager has an incentive to sell the questionable meat instead of throwing it away. I'm still nauseous from the smell and from touching all that rotten gray stuff with bleach. I think I ate this in the last one.",Very bad

I don't think I've ever seen a smile there, but it's quick.

I wasn't impressed at all.

The bartender finally played me some wine, answered my questions, and started down my drink. They had a good selection of wines and some that you don't normally find on wine lists in every other place in town. A few others came and we moved to the table. No problem. I started eating, we forgot about the wait, the pâté was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread, some were immediately addicted to the bacon wrapped dates, everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opted for the pre-selected toppings, others customized and added sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was being screened separately. were the fries but then we waited for the checks and the desert waited seems the staff didn't start trying to sort who had what until at least a half hour after everyone had finished eating and the plates had been cleared and none clearly knew how to use the pop system those with money eventually got tired of waiting and just left it on the table those of us with credit cards weren't so auckland several bills had to be redone because they didn't include the right items I had wanted to go back to try the salted caramel milkshake but that will be the case it will be a long time before I come back",Bad

So it's a bad branch. when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question, they never greet you with a smile and a hello or did you find everything you need while you are checking out, they have inconsistent policies on whether or not coupons can be scanned from the iPhone or if hard copies are required.

I advised that I was not a member and wanted to try their place. after doing my walk I understand why the place isn't very big, they have weights and cardin machines and the treadmills each had a personal tv on the machine. The whole facility looked clean and there were free towels to take with you for your workout. to insert your personal padlock, there was also a small room for classes. I wasn't very impressed with this gym, mainly because it was very small. I came on a Sunday afternoon, when most gyms don't see much traffic, so I don't know what it's like during normal busy times, like early morning and after afternoon on weekdays. and equipment, you might consider this place as an alternative to the big gym chains like Hour Fitness La Fitness or Life Fitness, you can always take a look for yourself, apparently they don't provide too much sales pressure to visitors anyway, that's my word on mountainside fitness at Bell Rd in North Scottsdale, next to the ice rink.",Good

The reception staff said it was going to be a minute wait. on the outside patio to check out the view within minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated our server was fantastic and friendly the food was delicious with large portions and surprisingly not as expensive as I thought my next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night we forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait we waited maybe a few minutes before seating our server but it wasn't as wonderful as our visit before he took a few minutes to get water and she kept blaming the bus the boys for everything the food this time was ok my dads prime rib came out cold like it came straight from the fridge all the side dishes were cold or overcooked it was a less than stellar experience this time if I hadn't been here before I definitely wouldn't go back if you want to try I say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had, the view and the atmosphere are what makes the restaurant",Good

I was a little shocked, leave your kids at home if they don't work at the restaurant. just have the lunch buffet I had a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes the fish dishes however not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the fish dish super fishy tasting the bread was really good which accompanied the meal so overall I would say I won't go back anytime soon nothing out of the ordinary",Good

I drove around a bit to see if I could grab a cup of coffee to kill some time. I stopped in the parking lot as there were several stores located in this mall and I shopped at a few stores here before finding this cafe squashed between other stores. It's a very small store with extremely limited seating, I will say I liked it here and really enjoyed my experience. reasons why their prices are cheap as all go out which is great i had an ounce of mocha for awesome service here was amazing and friendly and i will happily go back in the future so why stars there were huge tables to sit inside and that kind of problem i also asked the girl about the internet and she said the signal was in and out and should be fixed a few days after the holiday for me a cafe is a place i like to park at for an hour plug in my computer surf the net and drink coffee I don't like sitting outside because I don't have an outlet and my battery dies after an hour and in the summer I don't sit in the heat so although I would come back for the prices and service I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone planning to stay more than a few minutes",Good

I thought that too but the truth is it slipped my mind even though it shouldn't have and it hurts me every time I think about it I will never go back to that Johnny Rockets again if ever one of them because of that experience all I can say is if you are vegan or vegetarian and you go to one of the Johnny Rockets make sure your waitress knows that a bona burger is not meat, point this out to them because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",Very bad
6471,"I went to dinner today with three friends around noon on Sunday evening, although it seemed quite busy. I was happy to be seated within two minutes of arriving. The outdoor seating despite a hot Arizona summer was quite nice with some shade, but that's where the jokes end. Our table remains neglected for about twenty minutes. the pita sandwiches, hummus and garlic dip arrived relatively quickly twenty minutes later, both were fine, but something is seriously wrong if we all only got one pita with both dips and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our server for an extra pita and he kindly agreed that during the entire dinner it never came, refills were also a pain because we were asking someone to pick up our server and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later. sandwiches, I've been to many other businesses that did this kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour, half the tables outside were already gone, including the tables that arrived after us and we were the last to be served, the food was average quality and I have been better with slightly expensive cheaper prices, I can see it as justified, but many agree that time is worth much more than money. I lost an excessive amount of over an hour and a half in a decelerating Sunday evening. New customers like me aren't immediately put off. I can say with certainty that I will never come back here again and will end up in better places much closer to home.",Very bad

Drinks are somewhat specialty items and require a lot of work, especially considering the order line is at a complete standstill, slow after too long a wait. sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the quality of the food at Chestnut Lane, unfortunately this is not the case, I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost price for a turkey sandwich and iced tea I was expecting something fabulous, it wasn't quite that. If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, perhaps you could park in the spacious Jacinta parking lot just to the east and grab some breakfast to tide you over during your long wait.",Bad

4556,"I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say it was a horrible experience. What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu, this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-legal friends, so I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added some fried potatoes as a side and waited for my food. We started eating and my friend found a hair in his footnote, threw it on the floor and tried to properly drop it moments later. in both our plates I was so disgusted I couldn't eat my food and I was starving. I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she went back to the kitchen then came back to the register and completely ignored me, she said she would come back to my table before leaving. the burritos were pretty bland, needed some seasoning or hot sauce overall, I wouldn't go backless, I'm somehow developing a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen, I took a picture of my food before I tried to eat it and if you zoom in enough you can see some of the hair sticking out of my food, I'll post it",Very bad

I wish I had a receipt and could come back and talk to the manager but this lady just took my money and left me with a lousy job, really lousy.",Very bad
2522,"yuck, that pretty much describes this place we went there Sunday afternoon for lunch, only person in line in front of us, I ordered the meat combo, rib tips and hot sides of mac and cheese and potato salad, it took me some thinking to get my food but I figured if it was good it was worth the wait, but by god it wasn't good at all, the mac and cheese had no flavor so none, the potato salad was very flavorless and the rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in gallons of nasty sauce. the sauce on top of that their sauce is like a sweet and sour saucer not good at all the hot links were mixed with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce so I couldn't tell if they were good because there was so much of that damn sauce the funny thing was the couple who ordered right after me got their food and brought it straight back to the counter and said right away the food was just disgusting I wish I had made the same thing instead of spending on bad things, in short I won't come back here",Very bad

8634,"I usually get the Arizona smashchicken or the Arizona cobb salad, both are always delicious, sometimes they are very spicy and other times not so much, I guess it depends on who makes it and how many jalapeños are in it. The chicken is really tasty unlike many other chicken sandwiches. Salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal. i really like this place but it's a bit pricey for what you get, lunch for two will probably cost you at least it's not too bad but you'll go a lot further in other places",Good
7233,"ugh I don't like to give a harsh review but this is a store that needs to fix a few issues, the service, the long lines and rude cashiers, the outdated store, this wouldn't be so obvious if they just did some cleaning and merchandising of the products, maybe in this store they just shouldn't offer to produce, the small corner of the store makes you think it was an afterthought, I think a few things that wouldn't cost much of money would go a long way to making this store a place I'm not here right now.",Very bad
6200,I ate here last year and this is the second year I can finally compare the steaks to another place I love the decor because they are sports of all kinds there is always something new that you haven't seen before it is the perfect place to eat and study your surroundings I had the parmesan crusted steak I had the tomato bisque and green onions it is good I had the steak and I had felt like something was missing I don't know what as I don't eat a lot of steak the soup was great it was a cup and perfect the onion strings were good the steak was ok I will always go back but not for the steak I also wish their menu was wider with more dishes to choose from,Good
1941,"I heard this place was the best burger restaurant so I had to check it out for myself, my boyfriend and I went there on a Saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were occupied. People were coming and going, so my first thought was that they must be good because they were so busy. The servers were really nice and fast. an order of their smashed fries initially thought the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great after putting mustard and ketchup on it and tried to pick up the burger everything almost looked like it was messy and greasy it totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger it tasted just like any other burger nothing really special their fries were however amazing on a scale of I would give this place just for the presentation of the food, my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but I'll try again sometime",Good

8187,"ah man, I really wanted this to be good, but honestly you end up with something that looks more like a flame burn than the earthy wood-fired images you choose from their corporate-consistent signage menu and decor. too rich, the taste is like it should come from a squeeze tube anyway, it's pretty shitty, better than Pizza Hut, but despite all the fuss and flash you expect a lot more",Bad

A group of guys graciously let us share their table as the place was packed shortly after. One of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off. The next table starts fighting over beer, I'm not kidding, I then started feeling really old and overdressed, an employee comes to clean the empty bottles off my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid, I told him about the paid guy, he made a little joke about the guy who was upset about my rejection. Final analysis, the boss has cool employees and not so cool customers.",Good

I wouldn't call us lost at this point, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such a mistake. maze, I told him where we parked and he said it was a good hour walk back to our car, another mile or two or so to the third entrance, oh no problem, I thought since the town was laid out like a grid I didn't know there were exceptions to that, we insisted on thanking our impromptu guide friend, we walked and walked and walked passing other hikers and mountain bikers, finally the trail opened up to flat ground, we were close or so we thought when we reached the end of the trail there was no parking or street. Connecting us to where we needed to go was a long gravel road that snaked through a golf course and we started driving down the long gravel road until we reached the baseline in which we were determined to cut back to the west and find my car. I thought it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit, he asked if we needed a ride, my best friend and I exchanged looks. and then another and another until we finally hit the baseline, where the hell were we, that's when it hit us, we would have walked for more miles on foot to my car all these windy, rambling roads, damn golf course, fucking southern mountain, fucking unmarked trails, it should change its name to stupid trail because we just blazed it with enthusiasm, the nice hiker dropped us off at my car and left with a pretty big sigh to cover the horizon we unlocked my car, went inside and drove away from the prankster natural beast of the southern mountains, we counted the miles and minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car, at least another hour, the sun would have set by then and we would have missed our engagement dinner, lucky for us we stopped the right hiker friend at the right time, otherwise I might never have gotten home to write this review.",Good

I was there with three other people. One said the cuts of meat, especially chicken, were better quality than most Indian buffets, but he didn't like the sauces that much. Another friend said he liked the marsala tick, but that was about it. For vegetarians, we didn't have much choice. baby food than anything else, dessert was very good too and the rice was very bland so overall I wasn't impressed but I don't want to judge the place too harshly based on the buffet alone after the whole curry house was packed on a Saturday afternoon so I think maybe there is something better to offer me, I will have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections are like before I totally write this place off my list",Bad

As a teacher I have a lot of dominos and pizza hut all the time and I can be very happy about that, either that or I love a good slice of New York pie since I'm not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings I've checked out. menu for a good plate of delicious pasta, I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about pasta and they all looked bland and candid, too strange to order, then I found their sandwich section, I went for their spicy chicken sandwich which looked perfect, but it took a while for our waitress to come, so I had a look at the pizzas and found a few that sounded good too, god thank you, because when I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only served sandwiches at lunchtime, which really annoyed me. is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says lunch specials and where it says sandwiches I mean there is a real black line drawn between the toto me that says they are not part of the lunch don't you think instead I ordered the popeye and olive oil pizza which has a white garlic sauce spinach artichoke hearts olives klamath garlic onions caramelized mozzarella roma tomatoes and applewood smoked bacon after ordering it i really thought i didn't even want it really was really irritated my husband and i both ordered our own pizza as we couldn't agree on what we wanted so he got the vortex which had basically every meat you could think of for an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread which was way too much of garlic, it came with olive oil for dipping, I would have preferred a marinara sauce or something like that after eating the bread, I really didn't want my pizza to know that it had so much garlic in it, I picked a lot of garlic cloves with most of the other toppings, there was just too much, I know some people would probably like the witch, but it's just not my thing to have too much on my pizza, in Overall, the pizza was pretty good once I removed half of the toppings, the crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness.

I ordered samples before my cards three weeks ago, I haven't received anything yet. Now I know the turnaround time for the cards is a few days, but I received no confirmation that they were shipped or the method by which they were being shipped. the shipping and billing addresses are different, there is a box where you type your shipping address and then it takes you to the billing section when I received my order confirmation I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were the same at the top of the order and then further down in the order section this was where I had typed in my correct shipping address but it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me the shipping was to the correct address. another taste email saying the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address, I looked at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was entered at the bottom of my order, it was a matter of not paying attention. I guess the suggestions would be to either pay more attention to their customers' entire order or work on the billing and shipping page instead of leaving it as a box for typing words, especially if it won't be read.

I know a lot of people who have very positive things to say about this place. I won't recommend it as a personal favorite and frankly will probably avoid it unless it's specifically requested by a customer.

The same is true with pizza if you order a pizza there it will be delivered from another restaurant in Mayo shopping plaza. Nutria takes a large markup on food because they pay another seller for it, avoid this. that we were served a disproportionately small portion because we were using a group, we ordered two glasses of red wine, the waiter who was also the owner served us a glass which was of what is usually served, the only positive aspect of coypu is that they have a good wine selection to be honest, you would be much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like white chocolate grill, oh also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant there is over a year old, it has changed ownership several times and the overall quality suffers because of this avoid",Very bad

I know Saturday night is busy so maybe I should give the servers and chef a break. Sorry the menu has changed and so has the quality of the food and not in a good way, let me give you a brief sample of our experience. The tuna tartare appetizer was replaced with a dull combination of flavors. However, there is a complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The old tuna appetizer was much more tempting to move on to the arugula salad and goat cheese medallion. My salad was served without a medallion and literally loaded with a huge ball of cold goat cheese and terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm crusted goat cheese next we both ordered the parmesan crusted sole even though the sole was well prepared. There was a lemon sauce that delicately balanced the flavor of the creamed fish and the sole didn't mix well. I don't know if that was a mistake or part of the new menu, okay and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of snow peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some sort of soy sauce and oil. the poorly prepared food wasn't enough to bring down my joy, so I caution those of you who may have already enjoyed this restaurant like me, to think twice before spending a pretty penny at the goldfish.",Bad

5045,"Michael C is right, this place is very charming, I love the interior design with brick walls, I love the ""No Whiners"" sign hanging behind the bar, it's a small place but that's part of the appeal, there's a little patio upstairs with a fireplace that wasn't lit when I went, that might be a good place to hang, there's not much of a view but there's something cool about being at a higher elevation high, finding j chew was a bit of a challenge, we ended up stopping at a parking lot to ask for directions when we arrived, my friend and I headed to the bar immediately, we had a drinks menu in front of us I was more intrigued by the huge crystal slapstick trivia game I wanted to play when I asked about the beer, ah, not a big choice, but I will. as a singles the group of women sat outside on the small patio it was cold and cold in May and they had the fireplace going they also had a few heat lamps working but most of them were out of propane we Phoenix locals were chilling our coconuts if you know what I mean praise Allah for the fingerless gloves which were a big hit that evening but the bartender tried to keep them going so we appreciated his efforts in overall I like chewing but I can't rate it higher than for a few reasons, yes one is the beer selection, even though it's small that's also doable, but their mixed martini list looked disgusting, but I don't do martinis nor do I throw out mixed drinks, but the real trouble came from other customers j chew co, there is something defeated and sad about seeing another man. yell, lock him up at another man during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they love and follow individually, there's something even sadder about seeing an aging man with a cigar punching a married woman, he just wouldn't leave our group alone, well maybe they won't be here when I go back because I think if they are I'm going to have to say something about how obnoxious it is if you are in old town and looking for a place to relax this is your place and i loved the music they had on rotation from the humble mouse and post service to the s grunge and alternative rock i loved the tunes with the laid back atmosphere the great service and knowing there was a relaxing place in scottsdale to hang out who knew i just don't think there was a strong enough draw to stay at that place all night, it's more your thing before dinner or before another type of bar establishment, only problem is there aren't many other nice places in the area, I would be interested in going especially on a Saturday night when Scottsdale is out in force",Good

I just finished my meal, washed my hands and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a piece of paper covered in greasy sauce to throw it away. logistically stressful nightmare for me when you make it difficult for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there, I know they will read this and I know they will dismiss it just like my gripes, but do me a favor when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a planning degree to help you with the layout instead of just cramming things where you think they will go",Good

The pros are that the deeds are spacious, the well constructed grounds are clean and the grass is maintained, the swimming pool is well maintained. the parking is extra and not enough anyway, the uncovered spaces are just crowded in the rear parking lot the security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides the exterior walls are not high enough to really keep out an intruder.",Good
5860,"in a republic I voted Abacus Inn best Chinese in the valley, it's sad because Chinese can be so much better but I have to say Abacus Inn does something nice that I don't see too often in other Chinese restaurants, they give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you sit down. I had the Chicken Yuri Shan, it was a failure due to the inedible shia mushroom stems in my dish. I have to admit that the sauce was more developed than any sauce dishes I have tried at surrounding Chinese restaurants including Bamboo Café Ginger China Bistro and Shanghai La. I liked the use of cucumber in the dish, it was light, flavorful and successful, unfortunately the white chicken meat was dry, maybe a third cook was on the day I arrived and maybe this dish is normally better prepared. The closed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yuri Shan dish, this spicy beef was really very spicy. Szechuan sauce so I wasn't a fan of this dish here but I note that this sauce was better than what you get in the surrounding Chinese restaurants last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in very hot oil and fluff up the rice, it's a cross between Abacus Inn and Shanghai The Abacus does more impressive stuff but Shanghai Fluffy Chicken Cuisine",Good

Finally a blonde woman asks us if we want our bill, she brings it to us and when I give her my card I kindly tell her that they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill that another guy brings the bill back for me to sign.

It's worth noting that we came on a weekday when it's not as busy on the weekend as I've been to the area on the weekend and there always seems to be a line.

I asked for cutlery, then brown sugar and milk, then asked about my basket of willow bread. the waiter said it was the toast that came with your meal, I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam, I decided to stop complaining, I had made ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils, I put jam on the toast and it was literally like they had toasted it in bacon grease during that time, the table next to us, the only other table occupied in the restaurant in the morning on a beautiful Sunday, received their perfectly toasted cranberry walnut sourdough bread with all the fixings I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and mine tasted like pork, still vegetarian after years and he still said it's the toast that goes with your meal, my friend was embarrassed so I gave up and left how hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread ok now all the anger is stirred up, I have to say my florist is one of my away places on weekdays and their pianist is first of all amazing, she really plays with her soul and her personality comes through in her renditions of the classic songs where I've been there since the toast experience but have my friend arrive first to get the waiter with the ponytail",Bad

What I got was far from what I expected. indistinguishable from a piece of cardboard, they didn't even bother to put salt and pepper on this sorry meat, the rest of the sandwich was raw zucchini, chopped tomatoes, romaine lettuce leaves and a few pieces of red onion, none of the vegetables had been seasoned or seasoned. on cashmere, does your cook even taste what comes out of the kitchen, adds a little flavor to your food, you can start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper and high quality olive oil, it's really not that difficult",Bad

I started off by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a place that would be the dirtiest, dirtiest, dirtiest, most disgusting place to try and make it on earth. just driving into the parking lot, I didn't see much traffic from the crowd of MercedesBMWLEXUSJAGUARs and I may never be happy again After safely parking a block or so away, I walked in and admired the look and feel of old wood paneled tables and chairs from a high school cafeteria, an intriguing mix of regular flat screen TVs and score screens orbs yeah you can bet the ponies here are playing kings in a slightly less than royal atmosphere glad they must have a pool the tables are faded leland a whole group of people playing pool and frankly looking like they're not having fun extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching are not games meant to be fun happy i suspect there was some gambling going on happy the smell so can only be described as a extreme humanity few people within earshot did they do it so quickly so they have menus they have some sort of kitchen they have Jagermeister on tap they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet or swag for my friend Ryan C set up for our group it was supposed to be a happy taco bar so I provided a table full of taco fixins the centerpiece was the hot platter of taco meat what the fuck was so disgusting and sad that they told us it was ground beef but I know my beef and I don't think it was it was a land creature, perhaps some sort of unfortunate, indistinct animal that happened to be near the kitchen when duty called, of course as far as I know it was indeed the beefiest beef, not very good, sad, the hot tray holding the meat looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands. everyone was trying to fish meat out of the brine and using tongs instead. The idea was to try to extract as much fat as possible from the concoction, but in doing so I probably also extracted any flavor. Sad, I returned to the table and tried a nice trinket, added several shakes of cholla and tried another bite. with the wings, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled, no, not grilled, then dipped in crispy buffalo sarcenet, we will be happy, then they announced that the karaoke was going to start sonant, that was sad enough for me, adding amateur singing to this picture would have been too happy, but it's not all bad. adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank him for making the almost invincible village squash group happy",Very bad

I was a little amazed they were still there, there is one in Phoenix that comes in, it's the most junk restaurant I've ever been to except maybe bazooka grog ribs, it's a big place with soft lighting inside rooms everywhere filled with tons of barrels of furniture, so cluttering up all of them, this is all on purpose, of course, my booth in the middle of all this madness was actually quite ok, the floor elevation is up and down everywhere too, so for the first time in about years I just ordered the classic pasta, rich meat sauce which is their way of saying spaghetti, good stuff. I started with a cup of coffee, it was excellent. a cup of whipped garlic butter all on a bread board with a proper knife for cutting it was great a few things less wonderful a girl from the kitchen brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok but not great in the end they give you a lot to eat here my meal included the salad drink or soup the hot bread as a starter dessert it was good filling good value for money for everything happy rosemead ca formerly also west corina",Good

Sometimes you just surprise people on an off night.",Good
7198,"If I had written this review before an incident in September it would easily be stars. The bartenders were awesome. One evening, I was carrying a big trophy. Why, because I own one, I put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if I wanted a drink or if I wanted them to put it in the trophy. kicked out of bars for drinking said trophy before and it was the first time I had a bartender who was so cool every time I heard the bar staff were very rock even when they are extremely busy I think I ate here once so I'm not going to comment on that but I am here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode if you are at a table still eating at that time they have no qualms about moving your table if you have lucky they will tell you about it first its a good place to watch football etc. could maybe use a little more music from the tv nothing special it's your typical dance set you'd expect at any college dance bar since the crowd is often recent grads this suits the bar well I don't normally include bouncers in my reviews but after what I saw the last time I was there it affects my opinion of the place and is the reason the place doesn't get any stars that if you kick someone out and they leave peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on them other than maybe to keep them from falling, so when I see a bouncer aggressively push a guy who raised his hands in surrender and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who hasn't done anything wrong, that's just not cool, maybe it's just me, but I think someone who works for the bar should pick her up off the ground instead of almost stomping on her to help the bouncer who put her there while kicking out someone who doesn't give them any resistance on the way out",Bad

What I can't and won't forget is an unapologetic staff whose epic mistake led me to break years of meatless eating because of an ordering mishap. I ordered the Tomato and Red Pepper Quiche after minutes of waiting for the quiche to warm up in what appeared to be a degree oven. I took a bite first, a wave of nausea and panic washing over me after realizing it was a piece of Bacon and Spinach Quiche. I went back to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she was serving because she was sure she understood correctly. I'm out of it, thanks, I told her I was more upset that I had just put bacon in my mouth after years of no meat than the fact that there was no more quiche, she gave me my money back but no one apologized or offered me a reward.",Very bad

Potty stickers are actually pretty stuffed. My husband's shrimp dish was good too but the broccoli that sounded in the dish could have been cooked a little longer, it was pretty much raw, the table was a little sticky, ultimately I felt I could go to another Chinese restaurant and have a similar meal, maybe Tao would be slightly better or Tao is slightly worse.",Good

Stunning rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar gave a unique look. The service was friendly and the fast food was not very desirable. The salad was just iceberg lettuce and I got a strain with shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with white clam sauce. prices are good, it's not worth a subpar meal. The husband was also disappointed with his chicken marsala. The chances of returning there are slim to none.",Bad

8195,"I graduated from Marinello at the end of August and let me tell you I was happy to get out of there as the professors were very knowledgeable in their craft. The curriculum and administration were far from desirable when I first visited the school and started classes in January. I was promised a lot of things to learn, one of them being makeup classes, and to this day they don't have those classes available at the school and those were really big reasons why I wanted to go. There was also a lot of drama in the middle of my schooling, there were several administrators. they left a teacher and they changed everything we were used to, they started focusing on advertising instead of having students use the products and it often happened that school products disappeared that had not disappeared before the change of administration. Besides those things the school is fine, at least it will teach you what you need to know to be an esthetician in the state, but I definitely wouldn't go back and I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to go there, be sure to look at other schools before deciding what is best for you.",Bad

I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my messed up order which the delivery person made no attempt to correct I asked for the manager when they answered the girl who answered said to someone in the background without putting me on hold so I heard every word someone wants a manager I guess it's you the manager told him he didn't have time to talk to customers and started yelling at him about all the work he had to do on Friday, my friends, customers are the reason you are in business, so it would be a good idea to make some time for them. The poor girl came back on the phone after being totally berated by the manager and I told her what happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order. The only problem is that the processing takes hours. rudely she agreed apologetically, I asked for the owner's contact information if it was my business I would like someone to let me know if my employees treated customers like dirt, she couldn't provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.

1962,"Let's start with a subtype question. Scottsdale Stadium at the Park is like the Oakland Coliseum. An Oakland like Brickey Henderson c Phoenix Municipal Stadium d Yankee Stadium if you answered c, my friend, you're right and you're pretty smart too. Give yourself a pat on the back, much like the Oakland Coliseum. Phoenix Mini won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby. What you get here is a simple, functional annual ballpark that serves its purpose, the crowds. here they are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks but it fits people comfortably, unless you are in the premium indoor seats you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy mound, pick your poison so to speak, we still have the indoor seats because you can sit in rows behind home plate, I don't care about the bad economy, it is a good deal even if you sit directly behind home plate you will probably have a hard time getting see the small, outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfold, there are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Mini if you're not intimidated by the huge wieners, a footling hot dog might be for you, believe me when I say you won't be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you like hot dogs, I'm also a fan of the small dining area near the left field foul pole, you can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your drink of choice if you're lucky you can even watch the game from some of these seats. The people who work here from the ushers to the concession stand clerks are incredibly nice, they really want to make sure you have a good time at the game and that goes to show that parking here is very easy because you can park in the lot right across the street, the lot is rarely full and you can almost always find a spot. I have heard that there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more but why would you want to know though that the walk from the parking lot in front of the ballpark will take you about a few minutes, there is no crosswalk on the street and you have to use this ridiculous pedestrian bridge that they put up for the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans so star for good seats star for cheap parking star for horrible scoreboard star for the pedestrian bridge ask for stars",Good

I don't understand. Messy buns that all tasted the same. mushy mess that was hard to eat tempura bland no bueno I did however have a very good tuna poke salad but I wouldn't go back just for that if you want good sushi on the west side or the whole valley for that matter say no to banana and yes to Tokyo lobby",Bad

I take a bite and guess what they were barely warm. ask someone they took them off the bill but it really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table had finished eating before I even got mine.

5481,"This place is the least shower filled club in downtown Scottsdale. It's a huge club and in a way it's like a flagship store in a mall like Dullards or Ja Penny. You can get a little bit of everything you want in one place. It has its share of plastics and douchebags, but there are also a number of students who venture far from Tempe to go dancing. it's pretty cool if you can afford the fee, they have the required logo dancers with giant boots on some nights and they often feature good local talent. I haven't had to wait in line to go here in years because I always get invited to go, I think if I had to wait in line I just don't go, don't buy a girl a drink, apparently this place attracts pretty homeless drunks when it gets dark, these girls need jobs not tit jobs that have already been covered up. Myst is big enough that you can go there and manage to find a good time, the drinks are a bit pricey but that's to be expected in the area, it's a one stop shop for all your drinking, dancing and scamming needs. You are also very close to a large number of other small clubs of the same type. If Myst doesn't happen, one of the best parts is that it's across the street from a pizza place near the slice that stays open after hours just to feed the drunk idiots so they can sober up for the ride home. you'll probably either see a fight break out, some drunk chick throwing up on her hair or someone crying over something stupid, you'll also see everyone under the fluorescent lights not looking their best, the shine and polish is gone from their outfit and the product in their hair is gone and the girls' makeup gave up a long time ago and they're too drunk to suck in that gut or push out that chest, it's a lot of fun yeah, Myst is a good place to go if you want to go boxed in Scottsdale, send your out of town. friends here, locals who aren't into the scene will hate it, I kinda do it",Good

The dish with condiments of homemade chutneys is usually the highlight of a meal, so experiences with ordering might be: which is Bryan but then manages to serve a new variation that is nothing more than pieces of chicken thrown into a hodgepodge of rice and vegetables. Discouragement from substandard and overpriced food might lead to the decision not to order dessert after all, as observed in other reviews and on the menu.

Maybe it was the girls laughing a little too much or we were having too much fun for a barbet dive.

The floor mats were dirty when the car came in and spotless when they were replaced in the car, what a bargain if only the rest of the car. The result was the same when I returned a good few minutes later, the interior of my little car was still quite dirty, a fair amount of dog hair remained and the central area where the rack shift tray and gear lever are located was not wiped down. Let me tell you, there was definitely a reason to clean these areas.

My boyfriend and I were shopping separately and knew one of us was going to get it. a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced, they wanted to make sure they weren't paying too much, too little and her explanation that they had been in the store longer, it made no sense to them or to those of us in line but she continued to get upset until they gave up on the issue, she put people's items in bags and practically threw them at them and repeated without trying to fake some sort customer service, good night goodbye, my cashier was slightly friendlier but still not great, it was obvious she was having a long apteral night, she was stuck at the checkout with the ice queen, so that was understandable too, I didn't catch her name, but the girl working the locker room was really nice and kept greeting everyone who passed by.

Second our server was horrible, there were a few servers waiting for us because there was a table of people anyway, she took wrong orders and didn't listen to our needs and was rushed, then a new person came late to our table and she didn't even get served when she saw her, we had to track her down, I'm sorry but the number of restaurants I've been to was the worst service ever I mean. I had servers who were actually new who were new to the table and took their order once they arrived. I ordered a large size fried green tomatoes, an order of fried okra and a plate of sweet potato fries, the server gave me my fried green tomatoes but gave me fried okra and the sweet potato fries were horrible so I asked the server to take my sweet potato fries because it was horrible, the server took them away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much but I can probably fry these tomatoes a lot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered a size of fried okra and she said ok and took it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said she would charge me just the size of the order and finally when the server gave us the bill they were separate checks and didn't even do it correctly the server was putting things on the bill that didn't even belong on the check so needless to say I won't be coming to this restaurant again.",Very bad

The nightly rates were really cheap, it had more to do with my business than the property, although a fairly easy drive from the airport, you can almost bypass Phoenix to get to Scottsdale. were actually very spacious and the best part it was like having a one bedroom luxury apartment scaled down to the size of a full kitchen bathroom huge living area king size bed in a comfortable sized bedroom the hot tub rocked no one gave us a hard time having glass bottles there. Once I arrived I had to carry a ton of stuff into a room in one of the back buildings and I couldn't see my rental car maybe I'm the weirdest I like having my car nearby I unpacked my luggage and found out the internet in my room wasn't working I had to call the front desk and they had to move me to a completely different room I just unpacked my luggage. I have had dinner a few times with colleagues in their lounge when it wasn't great so we all ate out in the street the rest of the time just be aware you have a good chance of seeing spiders looming around you you have been warned but otherwise it is very clean I will stay here again expecting to get the same rates as last time but I understand having spoken to the girls at reception we booked at unusually low rates don't get sucked into it in this timeshare bullshit they don't grow like other places I've been but it's never a good investment",Good

7398,"I really hate doing this, this restaurant is for those who think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food, the buffet was pathetic and possibly had some items without white rice, my sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre. who I assumed to be the owner-manager was nice and friendly but that can't make up for the poor quality of selection and food.",Very bad

Too many TVs had the volume of the football game was impossible to hear, I will return though",Good

6056,the fitness part of this place is great the machines are new and plentiful good classes on the program and plenty of cold water and fresh towels now the spa on the other hand is mediocre at best the pool is a bit of a walk and accessible to everyone in the hotel even with the jacuzzi which also means the jacuzzi is outside why no jacuzzi inside the steam room is small and there is no sauna there are only shower cabins with shampoo and shower gel but no air conditioner the lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing and the bathrobes are super thin with a cold room which is not even nice and not very big I had to sit very carefully so as not to expose myself to everyone hello hah the massage itself was very nice but the spa is not relaxing especially for the prices I wouldn't go back to the spa even though the gym is good,Good

I've never had good lap swimming practice but the pool is immaculately maintained and the changing room is nice except during the summer when the kids make anything sticky a great facility overall.",Good

978,"my wife and friends went for lunch the other day and i liked it so i thought i would try this nice place, good menu, good choices, i had the meatball hero lunch, special good meatballs from the meatball hero with extra marinara for the cheese to make it a meatball part, it was way too big for lunch, i would have been happy with half of it with a handful of chips and a pickle spear of charcuterie or peperoni on the side vs just the hero sitting on the plate solo, I hope the owner reads yelp, I'll go back and try something else good the food is well located, it should do well, who mounted all these nice TVs in there, shaquille oneal, your neck hurts watching this high ps, hey food runner when you deliver a slice of pizza and it starts to slide off the plate, don't use not your bare hand to move the disgusting pizza, you know you saw me, look at you doing that too",Good
1523,"ok, there you go, I'll start with the bad and end positively regarding the pizza, that's what we went for, I wasn't very impressed, I have to say I'm more my style by the sliced pizza kind of thing, so the pizza didn't hit the spot, maybe a bit too fancy for my palette, you can take a boy out of the ghetto but you can't take the boy out of the ghetto, so for me simple food is always better, obviously there are enough people who love gourmet pizza because this place has amazing reviews so I'm just a simple guy. a fat obnoxious chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend that I no longer invest time in men who aren't available, put the pizza down, get a dry salad and shut up, it's not really the restaurant's fault, but I had to endure this convoy for the duration of my meal. pancake with Stella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good, I would be willing to come back here and try something other than pizza",Good

6213,"I think Sorta's high reviews must simply be a function of the limited dining options at Fountain Hills, because it's the worst excuse for tapas I've ever had. We walked in and were greeted by a strange musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal. We should have taken this as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the good reviews I decided to stay. turned around and got a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional we ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shia peppers and four different types of bruschetta. The olives were very difficult to mess up, but also contained compensating capers which we avoided. we chose to avoid the fat which he obviously added to the zucchini, the shia peppers had no spice or flavor and were absolutely swimming in oil. I've never had a roasted pepper so drenched in grease that the waitress asked us if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed all but a few were left and when we pointed out how fatty they were, they politely removed them from the bill. The four pieces of bruschetta were all different varieties. Roasted eggplant, ripe tomatoes, avocado and beans. and grilled artichokes with cheese, the bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor. In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and picked one at random from the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which one it was. The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato. The toilets were extremely dark and filled with unlit votive candles, so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at cost cutting, but if I had known that, I would have happily spared a box of patterns from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate. The place is also incredibly small so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have talked about would be performing if anyone tried to move there they would literally bump into the tables whereas I love tapas style meals if this was the only tapas restaurant there was one I would happily forgo the experience needless to say we won't be back",Bad

2403,"I've been going to pita since they were take out only in the next few years they are getting too big for their britches they started franchising they hired corporate morons and that's where it started to fail, chicken has always been great but it's faltering, there was never a better hummus on the planet until they added all the red oil, be very careful with the seafood. I absolutely love the seafood dishes here fantastic, but they made me sick on more than one occasion. I was even hospitalized once because of shellfish. I have good friends who are still managers so I go back every now and then to see them they aren't as thrilled either too bad all good things must come to an end it was the best undiscovered Arizona gem in years updated more red oil pretty solid but not what it used to be the lentil salad still kicks",Good

7196,"good very good cb average all around the decor was rustic and lodge-like but still open and modern no complaints here aesthetically pleasing and lacking the bright colors and loud mariachi music of more traditional mexican restaurants the table we were seated at seemed to have been randomly wiped down not totally clean our server was fine also quite friendly but generally seemed disinterested in her job and us and wasn't very knowledgeable about the food she was serving the food was good the salsa served with the Fries were perfectly fine enough fresh but not very flavorful, a theme we would soon learn would repeat throughout our dining experience. We started with the avocado spring rolls with a honey cilantro dip. These were the highlight of the meal. The sweet sauce complimented the creamy taste of the avocado well. My only complaint was the price of the standard size spring rolls which seemed a bit steep for what it was but still very tasty. in the first place a lot more standard mexican restaurants wouldn't like them to have more spices the rice side was pretty good but not as tasty as i thought it would be like the veggie tacos are also served with some sort of pickled cabbage and onion salad because the borracho beans that come with the other dishes are cooked with bacon the coleslaw was also good in general the food was okay but a little bland i should also mention that the portions are pretty reasonable two small veggie tacos and a little rice and coleslaw sometimes the portions as more traditional Mexican restaurants are absurdly gargantuan it was nice to see a normal sized, relatively healthy looking Mexican meal full disclosure here our visit to Black Chili was prompted by a card we received in the mail good for any meal so we figured it was worth a shot and it was but maybe not a return visit our discount bill for appetizers and two sodas came if it wasn't at the Baltimore, I say it was a bit steep but given the location it's probably on the verge of going back if the food had appealed to me, especially since it's in my neighborhood but it's not so a return visit is unlikely, there are enough solid, star-studded places around that don't usually make me a repeat customer",Good
7402,"the place is ok, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer, it's funny to read some of the complaints, people have a good grip, the food is good, the place is cafe style so your service is really up to you, the cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.",Good

3119,this place was just eh for me i was just overwhelmed nor the bar service it leaves little to be desired im not sure what it is like in Scottsdale restaurants thinking they must be snobbish towards people we ordered drinks from a unfriendly bartender and then waited a few more minutes to even be recognized again the food was good the berrimundi he liked but wasn't crazy about the side he came with i had the meatloaf which was good the sauce and the mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor my sister had the lamb burger with cold fries and not very good tasting there isn't much on the wine list either I probably wouldn't come here again because I don't think it was worth waiting an hour for the crappy service at the bar I would rather venture down the olive and ivy route,Good
4306,"I agree with Amanita if you have to shop at a whole foods store this is the one. The only attitude I got was from a few shoppers in cougaresque velor tracksuits, not the staff who were all refreshingly friendly if you stray from the traditional essentials, they are surprisingly price competitive or even cheaper than mass market grocers for normal food, they are still whole foods and still often outrageously expensive, their meat section usually makes me laugh, but if you are looking for something quite bizarre even the sprouts don't contain it there Chances are whole foods will contain it, but they will have an employee who can tell you everything.",Good

If you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you. If you're a fancy guy who wants real food, go to any other generic burger joint and you'll be happier.",Very bad

I also found a few spots that could use another wipe or two with a towel and the sunglasses case was never touched and therefore dirty. Make sure you visit at the beginning of the week and not on the weekend to get the best deals I paid for interior and exterior details.

671,"Totally disappointed, I had bought a voucher from Travelog to try this restaurant and given the location I would have thought it was going to be very high end and we were expecting a lot more. The service was great but the food wasn't worth it. The restaurant itself is very outdated. My husband and I had the crab cakes for appetizer, they were cold when they were served. ounce of this was pure fat and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat, I ordered a wild mushroom pizza which was ok, this place needs a major overhaul if they want to make money at the restaurant which for a Saturday night at o'clock when we went was empty, I think the highlight of the meal was the cabinet bottle",Very bad

I've been to several comic book stores and I don't need anyone to hold my hand. I would just like a common courtesy on the positive, it was an organized place and the selection was pretty good.",Bad

We were disappointed with the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers and one ordered a remade choice from the menu. We had the dill chips and fried pickles as an appetizer. interested in going back, it just wasn't any better than what you could make at home and I burn soup, the tables were too close together and the place was uncomfortably noisy our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us put a fork down, no one was waiting for our table and asking for our dessert orders while we were still eating, the whole experience was rushed, uncomfortable and not engaging in any way, I'm so disappointed",Bad

I asked what size cup to get and he said oh you wanted a drink of course I wanted a fucking drink I just looked at him like a man told him to keep his drink because he has to rerun my card really it's a chain that gives you all the equipment and training to make a sandwich like the other quizzes across the country and you can't do it if you hate customer service don't buy a two star franchise sandwich shop lucky you its not one, I am absent",Bad

The server being the bar was professionally friendly then the wait started fifteen minutes went by and I still didn't have a salad. the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come around the same time as me a few minutes later my salad and pizza came out at the same time very disappointing I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to get cold note it is an extremely thin pizza like a cracker crust it cools very quickly the waiter offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but as there were fresh tomatoes on it I didn't want the pizza to be ruined the house salad was fresh, good ones mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese there were lots of red onions and the house dressing was very strong and vinegary for me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order this particular salad again the pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together quite well even considering how thin the crust was.

The servers I have encountered are all very patient with people coming and going within the group and individual checks for everyone knowing how painful it is. happy hour it's a great place and the Tempe Market location is convenient for several friends",Good
9606,"ok, I usually write longer and more complex reviews about a restaurant, but for this new establishment I will summarize great decor and ambience, but friendly service from flat screens would be better, but needs more training in food and knowledge about cooking timing. If a table has two or more people, the food should come out at or around the same time, especially when they are not sharing food. If you specialize in spring rolls, make sure they are rolled competently. for the spring rolls, the rotating flavors for the rolls are not good value for some items, but I agree with other reviews that for most items the price is a little high for the neighborhood business and the quality of the food offered overall, a nice place to have a drink with friends and a snack before dinner elsewhere. i believe the owner or chef is inexperienced, i hope this will improve the guys work",Good
7799,we had our first experience on a friday night about the waiters were pleasant the wild tiger has a nice patio overlooking the center but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system the interior was clean with a combo bar and show kitchen we started with the fresh rolls with hot peanut sauce and a nice lychee martini but not the best in town the pure sushi bar has one to die for lychee and lemon the starters are huge and could easily be shared we had the know hot and spicy clear noodles chicken broccoli snow peas sweet onion thai chili garlic and basil mild thai delicious to be fair thai is not one of my favorites but we like to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended glad to have tried it and for those of you who like it hot and spicy wild tiger has got you covered,Good
4738,"me and three girlfriends went to pétanque for a happy hour after reading all the wonderful reviews on yap, i was really excited when going there but felt disappointed for me, it was a bit big on commercial, the decor was a bit cheesy, i think the red leather chairs are important wall lights, even a red velvet torn lounge hardly original or intimate enough to be considered an authentic wine bar in my opinion, if you are a chain regular of restaurants, you'll probably think it's a cute place, call me a snob whatever. we are talking about the wine list at this wine bar, it was ok but they were out of our first two choices of red, it was not ideal for a wine bar, then we ordered our skewer for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in half knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have told us, we ended up ordering a second plank for the table so we could each try the variety, I have to say that the skewer was good, we were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday evening which I love until lunchtime, but I found it a bit rude that the waitress came six minutes past the hour to ask us if we wanted a second round, there was no grace period so we paid full price, we noticed our full price wine glasses were filled to the brim so maybe the price of the wine don't get me wrong, the place is quite cute, this would seem like a fancy hangout if I was still in college, I would go back with girlfriends but won't go back with my husband, I would have liked to try more food because that seems to be the key to that the ambiance and service of the place is good, not great, oh and the music could use updating, the playlet was interesting, maybe it's my love for the post or maybe it's because I was on Mill Avenue, I instantly judged the place",Good

The egg roll I tried was really salty even without sauce and nothing special. Sweet and sour sauce can usually make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the ss sauce on the buffet was a downright scary koolaidred color, but the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the different flavors of ice cream on the other end of the line, I will say it was pretty cheap per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, this might be a decent option for you personally, even if I just think I'm past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels and artificial colors.",Bad
2960,"I loved the old menu but the changes made me change my mind, they had the best sandwiches, it was always quiet until you could sit down and eat, the new menu is ok, we liked what we got but we would have left if it wasn't happy hour even though the portions are large, maybe too large, the prices are delayed now the Buffalo chicken offerings were pretty good but maybe too spicy in a bad way. the waiters are generally slow and quite inattentive but the menu brought us back sad to see it change this way",Good

When we decided to try again, we arrived about a few minutes after they opened, desperately wanting to guess what the bartender hadn't come yet to go somewhere else, we really wanted a non-judgmental Bloody Mary when she arrived and we walked by and asked if she could make heathens. for hiring a parade of careless, unsupervised mailers who are slowly ruining the excellent reputation that Robson worked so hard to earn",Bad

I'm not sure they really do anything other than rugs. tires even a stranger told me how strange he found it they missed it they also asked for air freshener and when I got in my car it still smelled like mom it didn't smell fresh and clean I just left there and again I had to ask them to clean the inside door it was covered in dirt and dead grass how did you miss that when I called someone to clean it he then noticed that the windshield was always dirty I mean really and again no air freshener even though I asked for it I gave stars instead of because I appreciate that it's not a chain I'd rather give my money to a family place than a corporate trash the tall blonde woman who greets you is always very nice and helpful I like that I'm not in a rush to get my windshield or cracks fixed a million times and sometimes they have deals on Livingsocial which is great overall I feel like it's a good place to come and just have the surface of your car washed unless you want to pay a lot of money to see a difference inside your car make sure to check your car before you leave to make sure they actually cleaned everything",Good

1471,"I came here one morning a few weeks ago, had about a few minutes before my appointment at the mayonnaise clinic, so I figured a small stack of banana walnut pancakes would get me in and out quickly. I thought the bad staff was friendly enough, but it took at least a few minutes for the server to finally take my order. banana walnut pancakes, they were blueberries delivered by another waiter, my waiter came over to ask if I needed anything else, I heard my complaint and went back to the kitchen to correct it. I was assured it would only take a few minutes to get a new batch, but another few minutes passed before the correct order arrived. Keep in mind it's already been at least a few minutes since I sat down, I only had a few minutes to spare, not enough to enjoy these delicious cakes, the blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but it's difficult. for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I have to suffer, I'll probably visit copies again the next time I'm out and about and have a craving for pancakes, but only if I have a few minutes or more to spare",Bad

I wanted to be surprised to see classical sculptures and handmade artwork and I didn't see any here because I'm very particular about historical eras and movements of interest.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I continued to watch it. I think it was the loud growling that caught my attention. wait no it's not, it's a dollar, no, it was a dollar no, that was last month, it's money per hour, better empty those pockets, just remember that for every hour you waste gambling you could have fed starving Ethiopians for a month, but in your drunken state you chose to serve like me and play pool or ping pong. she looks at you funny, it's either because you asked her twin or because you asked for buffalo chicken tenders, also if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you get out, but of course you have a designated driver overall the food I ordered was excellent the service was the food was really good",Good

I have eaten at fast Indian restaurants and they are much better than this one. who appreciate text service, cute containers, and chatty owners, I want to support family-owned, local restaurants, but I also want to support the good ones and not encourage the bad ones to emerge just because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here",Bad

I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her and she returned to her conversation for the next few minutes. she and the girl she was talking to looked at us and laughed every now and then pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed dishes, but after a quarter of an hour of trying to get their attention with them laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I were fed up with the way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and headed across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. We will never return to this restaurant and I suggest you. don't do it either, just as it is not acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it is also not acceptable for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have done nothing to deserve poor treatment. We do not deserve the type of treatment we received at this restaurant and I am seriously angry writing this review.

I stopped by recently with a friend while in the area and Rosa seemed less busy. Our assumption that this place could be livelier was perhaps correct in that there were people at the bar rather than the baseball games and various other sporting events we had chosen to sit at the bar for. bar because I still think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was quite slow on a weeknight, this issue of better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed like the bartender was also taking care of issues around the restaurant and after finishing my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for a while before someone came to see a refill, I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me and as pouring drinks is the main function of a bartender, it was more than slightly annoying, we ordered the hi appetizer for a starter, I know I should probably be slapped for ordering something like that at a sports bar. I took a few bites and everything was fine, but parts of the fish were actually starting to turn gray, which can't be a good sign for dinner. We had the salmon and a side dish. The two bartenders on duty praised the flat fare. I don't think they've ever had a dish anywhere else or they'd probably stop raving about these. cheese sauce and a few pieces of chicken, it was edible as a food dish, but what I found off-putting was that the bread seemed to take on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served on. Yes, I know you can bake bread on wood and it will take on the flavor of the wood, but I'm sure that came from the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste was gone the next day and it all served well for about a few minutes in the toaster oven. the side of broccoli that came out with the fish was bright green and flavorful and cooked perfectly the fish was a little overdone and uninspiring I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu so they can have more consistency in the preparation",Bad

Apparently I've heard this happens a lot if they've worked before, this last trip was just bad. I was a little out, but maybe it was those old people's eyes, I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects, I arrived a few minutes early and mistakenly thought it would be too late to get a good seat for an afternoon screening, by all means I was about a few minutes too early, they booked the screenings way too close, the credits for previous screenings lasted until about and then as always they took their time to clean the theater once you enter. contempt would have been welcome if just for a little light, that's why God made cell phones when he finally sat down, there were two cans of soda in both cup holders. I literally saw people leaving the theater at the end of the screening. The cleanup should be quick so you can continue your discussion about whose identity you were using to go out that night, but I digress. The soda cans obviously weren't being sold by the slowest concession employees in the world. i hate when people have their cell phones on in the theater because they always want to hold it up so everyone else in the theater has the pleasure of the bright light while they chat on their old myspace account, but in this case it's understandable because no one could see anything in question and i always wanted to ask if the concession stand employees said to take it as slow as possible, well i know they aren't, i'm a former employee and i wasn't not even though the pennies they give generously on paychecks might not be enough fire under them but seriously it's already an insult we have to pay just for a popcorn and a soda but they add salt to the wound that is by making us wait for minutes in a line of people by god I wish someone would open a concession stand with good deals yeah I know that's how they get their money blah blah and I wish someone would open at least one express lane two items or less lane no kids heaven really movies are still relevant even in a down economy maybe you should hire less and pay more im sure that one the guy at the box office would have appreciated that",Bad

9847,"Friday evening, after a long work week, seemed like a good time to treat ourselves to some new cuisine, so my friend and colleague John M and I decided to visit this Uzbek restaurant. The interior would be rather generic in appearance without the somewhat ornate Middle Eastern curtains and a screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos adding to the ambiance. cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette and blinchik which are pancakes with a savory meat and onion filling. Be careful, the blinchik are quite filling on their own. We also ordered pavlov and lamb skewers. The pavlov was a flavorful seasoned rice dish with carrots and meat and was a good choice. meal overall it was a good meal not great but definitely satisfying and hope to try the soup dishes next time",Good

I can't say for everyone that I really don't like waiting half an hour for a table, call me impatient, I don't care, I really don't think many restaurants deserve that title, even on a Friday night, I love that they have a full menu for gluten free diners, it's so hard to find gluten. free at restaurants doesn't even mention a full menu I was impressed I ended up sharing artichokes with parmesan I didn't ask for breadcrumbs with my mom and got myself a Chicken Caesar both were okay we ended up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflé be sure to specify that you want it gluten free as they also had a regular version which was amazing and I would definitely go back just for that overall a good weekday family restaurant which is above average meal definitely a place to go if you are celiac or gluten intolerant",Good

This is where all restaurant operations take place. but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing in the sink and I don't need to see all the potential for cross contamination during food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses.

I just think it's appalling, how can your doors not work in your store, how are people supposed to get in there to shop, the manager of this location is nothing more than an imbecile.

403,"Came here for lunch recently with active assistant and friend Brett B. I'm sure he will post his own review of the place. It's the kind of place where you walk up to the cash register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the waiter brings you your food, you also grab your drink and go refill yourself at the fountain. i expect that in most places the waiters make a size with their hands, shrug their shoulders and say i don't know like that, so yeah i like that this guy showed me a plate and made a mound with his hand to show me some sort of size of the salad when i ordered just water he went and gave me a plastic cup with a lid and then said you know what, have a regular glass it's more comfortable it trusted me not to fill my glass with anything other than water and I only drank water which was nice and made me feel like an adult not like some places much cheaper than this place they give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor when you order water. I really enjoyed my lunch here. I had a chicken Caesar salad, one of my favorite things to order almost everywhere I go because I will never make it at home with a cheese pizza. The Caesar salad for those who have a love affair with this meal was perfect. even distribution and reducing the pain of having to cut a chicken breast on a salad with oversized utensils like so many other places, it was dressed perfectly too, not too heavy, just right and the parmesan was shaved on top rather than grated or grated. nice to the touch, great flavor in every bite, the cheese pizza was super thin crispy crust, delicious red sauce a little sweet in a good way and the cheeses were mozzarella and the salty taste mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made it simple the taste of the pizza is extraordinary, I had a beyond amazing pizza in New York, I am spoiled and I have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonnos in the pretty Upper East Side, but it's still very good, I'll eat it again. be a great choice for those of you who like to order delicious salads and the service was excellent the manager even came to our tables to refill our glasses for us even though the drinks were self serve from a fountain the place wasn't busy when we arrived but it picked up as we finished our meals good food great service good atmosphere hope this place stays will definitely look forward to eating there again even",Good
5661,"oh man, this is not the place I thought I would give my first rating, I woke up as sad and disappointed as last night leaving the legendary old school during after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service, sigh, honey, I had a great lunch there a few months ago and was excited to impress myself with the dinner we saw during restaurant week and we were excited about the excuse to get Sneak into one of their cozy booths among bowie-clad staff and velvet wallpaper. experience, should I blame the low rating on their efforts to succumb to a prix fixe menu, perhaps our time at the bar turned out to be the best part of the night watching the bartender mix the martinis like my dads used to do was nostalgia at its finest. in the weeds having been in her place before I'm still trying to adjust to the situation we ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed capable the artichoke dip appetizer was delicious tortillas and garlic bread and hot cheese dip delivered promised the limited menu was just that ok first course soup options main dish offered pot roast a small steak or chicken fried steak slow cooked steak grilled steak or fried steak really your menu is impressive you really don't want to participate in restaurant week so don't honey I ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after pointing out the fish option. I ordered the fish too because the food took a bit but we had a good conversation so it wasn't a problem. The salads and soup were good. The main course arrived and we were all a little surprised by the size of the fried steak. a dollop of thick sauce on top, the garlic mashers were placed appropriately, my trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon and caper sauce, but instead it was covered in a sauce that hinted at lemon and was not at all good for a fish. I don't want mashed potatoes to rule your dinner, we were devastated so the whole experience was not what we came for or expected. I want to give Durant another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do so many people, but it will be a while before our trek around downtown includes a stroll through their kitchen.",Bad

I had the original tart which was a bit tart. The toppings are okay. My friend really liked the fact that they had banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our stuff at home and we were away from home and she didn't have to use her personal stash because it made her happy. put an extra star, I'm cool like this hamlet, let's see they have a snow machine, I'm not really sure what that is, it seems out of place, it's far from my house and not really worth the drive, I guess if it was near me and I had no other options, I patronize this business, this is the one time and only time I will say this, thank goodness I live in Old Town Scottsdale",Bad

Most of the wine glasses arrived within the next few minutes and still no bread or food that I needed to continue and although the server apologized profusely she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly unhappy group, the food was good, the roommate's burrito is quite remarkable but not a good enough reason to return.

The pizza was obviously there forever but it was a pretzel pizza that was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it and then the show starts. sweaty face on hand gets money, then makes pizza with topping with bare hand, places it in the oven without gloves, this happens over and over again, then when his friends come there is a series of hand slaps, where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands, so in the minutes I'm here, I don't wash hands with gloves, his hands on food toppings, money, hands face with every possible surface, fucking disgusting, but it gets better, his friends with whom he is conversing are about to ice the cake, one of them, this guy with red hair, reaches behind the counter near the pickup and grabs fries from the trash can with his hands, this happens no less times, another asks him to meet them in the bathroom, uh, yes, this locked bathroom father is closed to customers hmm, my imagination can only wonder what brief activity happened in the toilets. give this guy some points at the end of the night he started taking over the place as it had slowed down nicely, that's obviously his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyway but I was surprised at this point and my food wasn't eaten, we finished having fun watching it all and he asked to take our plate. I appreciate that, but honestly there is no excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place.

They have done a very good job of being a sports bar but not impressive they claim their meat is freshly ground but when it is the patty has a different type of shape and is less flat and compacted ok maybe they grind it in the morning and then stock up on patties for the day which is ok the bacon I ordered the all star bacon and cheddar beef was lame thin a bit of a dead end and not crispy the cheese was good i liked that the meat was grilled and so it tasted good also the inside wasn't overcooked and the bun they served it on was pretty sweet and tasty giant actually the sides were blah coleslaw was really boring and literally had ingredients white cabbage carrots sweet mayonnaise something i would expect from chili peppers or Dennis, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring, Stella wasn't as cold as I prefer, our staff was very good so far, a place ok to visit, but a star location is somewhere I'll probably go out of my way to visit, it didn't make a difference.",Good

I have to preface this review by saying that the owner here is quite charming and I'm sure he has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking as a supporter of organic produce. I had way too many hopes. a seat eliminating our initial confusion to keep this review to the point we ordered a bland smoothie, a frittata very small and actually strange like it could have been cooked in the microwave, I need to say more than two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not cooked well and the flavor was not allowed to develop. the soups needed a good development and the herbal infusions which are obviously lacking in the kitchen. I would like to offer a suggestion that might help so that she can spend more time making soup and less time running around the table at the front, and that is to consider a different style of serving. The place is so small that she might ask customers to order from the board if it's legible, then deliver the orders. I wish him the best in his business.",Bad

Basically spent a total of an hour and a half waiting and having an attitude and nothing was resolved because of their information and hassle, idiotic customer service ethic and pride of the last lady, no one resolved anything and they were all too proud to say we apologize for the inconvenience, I recommend this place if you want to be late. work or more hours and have your mild-mannered patience tested to the max",Very bad

Prices are generally lower than other major grocery stores. Their Kroger brand products, such as condiments, are generally of good quality compared to store brands from other stores. However, in recent years, vegetable prices have skyrocketed, with the exception of tomatoes, celery and lettuce. making it more difficult to find the items you are looking for and making what should be a quick trip through a Balfour ordeal the aisles also seem to be more difficult to navigate with bulky displays sticking out here and there and it is difficult to get around other customers.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due. The guys come up to you and are very polite. and the exterior wax job looked awesome on the negatives when I came out to see the work they did I immediately noticed several spots on the interior which they cleaned up after pointing them out I also noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a detail-oriented person.

5408,"I have a lot of nice and uninteresting things to say about Phoenix's latest venture into serious public transportation construction, a good thing, mainly because it's new, the cars are really clean after living in LA and using the subway, everything seems cleaner than this, let's just hope they keep the light rail clean in the years to come. the current downtown stops are well thought out once you get off, something is always within walking distance, good thing the price of the Allay pass is worth it, unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is usually on time and a reliable way to get around. There don't seem to be any car companies trying to keep the city going by closing stations like they did in the 1950s. The only logic to taking light rail is that it's basically a car you don't have to park or fill up with gas, it's not. that it's slow but actually only goes slightly faster than the cars traveling next to it on the street, the slowness of light rail comes from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you've decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would have been to build the light rail above or underground so it could go faster and not have to stop at lights or risk some idiot pulling it and T-boning one of the passenger cars, but I know this experiment is still in the training wheels stage. but I really wish they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix Scottsdale or Glendale. I heard they are planning a route in Glendale, but that will probably take another ten years, even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops. I really wish I didn't limit myself to downtown Tempe or Mesa. Phoenix is ​​trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown, we're not kids, this city shouldn't set a valley-wide curfew before midnight, metro is more of a word than not, it has its flaws that it still needs to work out and it's a little difficult to judge something that is in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.",Good

I couldn't taste any type of kick from the roll. Stay away from happy hour rolls. What I think might be helpful is to describe what is in each roll rather than listing all the rolls on a sheet of paper so you can choose and how much. salad and yoga tend to be the least expensive menu items to prepare.

There can also be a wait for a table and the environment is noisy so be prepared to shout a bit if it's busy, they do beer tasting some nights, I didn't participate but my dad who was visiting made the food varies in quality or maybe just varies in recipe quality, my table friend orange and I shared a pork chop special and it was pretty bad but I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of bread delicious. The low end cheese sandwich, I haven't tried the deluxe one yet as for breakfast I don't remember it being particularly spectacular but I think it was better than your average breakfast.

The Wigwams ballroom has now been converted into a red steakhouse. The service started well with a nice touch of fruit choice for your water. The server had recommendations but also allowed us to think about the menu. We opted for the couples dinner, essentially a prim five with a choice of sea bass salad or steak and shared dessert. We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer just to venture off the menu a bit. presentation with fresh crab and a crispy grilled top and colorful spinach underside the avocado dressing was a little heavy on the crab and looked like fake guacamole in cheaper restaurants but the crab was dry and the waiter brought us more of that dressing the service with the Caesar salad the presentation started to falter the salad is the craze for serving whole stalks of romaine and a slice of toast reminding the waiter of salt and pepper, he quickly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder, my friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we wanted another pepper grinder actually for the price of five. I really wanted the server to politely grind the salt and pepper on our salads. The crouton had no flavor. Our steaks were cooked as ordered, but my strip didn't have much flavor. burning to retain the rare juices, the steaks were true to the server's size, the steaks were served with two stalks of asparagus which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique vegetable for the plate, a potato pancake au gratin also accompanied the steak and was quite delicious. attentive and sometimes confusing, we were just eating when the waiter dramatically closed the curtains on the window near us. One of the other diners called in sadness about losing the evening sun, but the waiter shushed him and told him they would be open intermittently to avoid dazzling the other diners. Should Reds consider awnings or subtle blinds to preserve the view of our restaurants?

I kind of wanted to leave after that but I had ordered my salmon starter from the beginning and now the starter which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on top and raw skin underneath wasn't doing it because for me it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. or maybe they just had a bad cook that day.

I told all my foodie friends about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a truly special dining experience in Phoenix. I went back with friends twice over the coming months and was delighted each time I went back last Saturday and I have to say I wouldn't suggest it again for a special night out, it felt like the magic had gone and the place was showing its age and losing its specialness. really good chef talent shows but too many other disappointments when we arrived for our reservation the place was packed the host was friendly and told us our table would be ready soon and that's when we sat at our table and that's when things started to not go as well as expected sitting in a back corner which I didn't mind noticing the walls were grimy, beaten up and dirty that was my point of view so of course that's all I could focus on the waiter didn't show up for a minute to take our drinks order and when did it take a few minutes to bring them to us he apologized but on a Saturday night waiting for a first drink was no fun when he then sat down with our menus and chose our choices it was then we were told they were out of veal which of course we had chosen to that time and there was only one skate dish which of course the other one of us had decided on, they were out of other items as well. Many items on the menu may be fine when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with, it's a real disappointment. The pop rocks which I thought were so fun as intermezzo instead a spoonful of something not described was placed in front of us, a simple salad and most of the starters are at least as good but not worth the price, otherwise the starters were special but tasty and served with good presentation. Cotton candy always gets attention and I always love desert. selections, especially the malt which I ate with mini donuts and dips, I think I can overlook the fact that it's really not an appealing calming energy from the kitchen and the tables close together add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting are ugly and now that's starting to look run down as well.",Bad

As for food, everything I tried was ok. They changed their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the others weren't crispy enough. change that caused them to lose the star for this review, I would rather have the soggy, tastier ones, who know how they make these new ones so crispy anyway, when I go here it's almost always for convenience and late at night, few places of this caliber stay open until morning so that's about all there is when you need a late night meal in this part of town, their star rating is clearly based on eliminating one of my favorite places, fathers office with no star and for ignoring my comments about the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries less star, they also lose a star for keeping the prices but replacing the quality of the Phoenix strip mall",Bad

I was first impressed with the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so one knows what is safe, kudos for that, it's more than most places offer, but they have a basil pesto sauce listed as not being gluten or soy free, finding this odd, I asked the server to confirm with the chef and was told there were no wheat products in the pesto, which seems okay, I didn't ask about the soy but I would bet it sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese, so I ordered your own gluten free penne pasta with pesto sauce shrimp peppers spinach and mushrooms when my bowl of pasta arrived it had all of the above but also had onions zucchini and eggplant but I had to dig around to find a shrimp. and I offered to replace it as I ordered I would have eaten the original bowl and told him so but I was more concerned as I said it was someone else as a side note if these extra vegetable flourishes are an example of cooking skill I would say if a customer orders a simple menu item it might be acceptable but when I fill a nice little checkbook with what I want to create your own bowl of pasta I just want that the items I checked in a fresh bowl later arrived exactly as ordered, except the pasta was undercooked, I don't mean, really firm and fiery, I mean, some were still far from cooked now, I know gluten free pasta takes longer to cook and they probably rushed to the bowl to get it to me, but that bowl was almost inedible. The waiter offered to get me a third. inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice missed dinner, I have no intention of going back",Very bad
1333,"after repeated visits it only made the service worse, it was like we were held hostage and couldn't leave for a full minute because that's how long it took to receive a time check after multiple requests to several different employees. The female servers can be a little cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and it's a craft brewery. not bitter, it's not a truetostyle spa, so people say oh I don't like the pas and I want something else, their attempt to rename a style of beer is actually hurting them, amazing, the menu was not the usual menu, just a small list of choices to make things worse, the actual menu on each table was wrong, but they kept the menus on the tables anyway, I heard separate tables ordering fried ravioli but they didn't have them no, this place is only in business because of its location.",Very bad

2959,"first experience, I tried the turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu, the burger was ok but greasy, they served me a salad which went bad, you don't serve salad with rotten vegetables, the Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zucchini so they should have warned us about it not being a good Shepard pie. Gordon Ramsay would have been crazy, the service was good only a saving grace",Bad
4486,"good price for the location but it is definitely outdated and the appliances are extremely old, maintenance people fix things quickly but some solutions are subpar, my neighbor and good friend keep having water intrusion in their house when it rains hard, they have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times due to water coming in from under the building. are too corporate and only care about money and not the longevity of a rental well paid on time. The only reasons I stay are because the location and price are good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate the rent will continue to rise and well above what other nearby apartment properties have to offer, this would mean I probably only have a year or two left before the rents for a two bedroom run out. tenants, it's really unfortunate because I guess companies prefer to have long term paying tenants and negotiate rent amounts and try to weed out tenants who are constantly late or don't pay. Keep in mind no utilities are included, I hope to see some changes in residential equity but due to their corporate status I don't think that will happen",Bad

6797,"when Fresh Easy started popping up everywhere it was my new go to place for quick and easy meals, they have a great selection of starters and ready made salads that beat all the way through, the fact that there were always great coupons to receive might have been a big factor in why I came back so often. that they start to deteriorate after or a few days, which isn't very practical or save money when it means I throw away half of what I buy. I am very conscious of item expiration dates and have even found myself throwing items away before they expire so unless you plan on cooking with your fresh items that day I would avoid produce and even some dairy and meat products so what I am saying is frozen or canned goods I am pretty sure your safe with this particular location has also been my least favorite to visit as far as the friendly staff I usually have to visit to bag my own groceries, yes, I know self-checkout keeps prices low, but when you have or staff members hanging out near the checkouts with few to no people in line it wouldn't hurt for someone to take a stab at bagging groceries, it's a little customer service thing that can keep someone from not coming back.",Good

I had a deal, I didn't mind as the ambiance is nice and I loved the extras, we had a few little palate cleansers, the cotton candy was fabulous and although the strawberry dessert wasn't my first choice it was really delicious and I might go back just for that dish.

A single drink is actually glasses in case you're torn between sharing a bottle or just buying a drink. I recommend the shooting star taxi, it was full-bodied and very delicious. The other wine we tried was the Hob Pinot Nob and it wasn't great. It had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones. we had to choose either free hummus or dessert because of my agreement to check in on foursquare power nerd, I know I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and the rotten bread for those of you like me who don't know what rotten bread is, it is much lighter than pita bread and a bit thinner than a tortilla, it is very tasty, the hummus was very good and they topped it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which I loved, we also ordered the pan fried eggplant. it was awesome it was a large slice of eggplant with a black sauce which was a technical term in case you were wondering they also served the eggplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good plus a small scoop of red chili sauce our waitress told me the name and I couldn't remember it for the life of me which was spicy I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spices for the eggplant, I will come back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu which I can't pronounce there are lots of vegetarian and vegan options clearly marked on the menu their menu also boasts that everything except or items is completely gluten free, good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal",Good

The owner guesses why the traffic was so bad at first, he didn't know, but then he realized the restaurant was closed, he politely recommended we head south and then cross back to the I ordered the Jerusalem falafel sandwich, it was pretty good, but in all honesty, falafels are not one of those kinds of dishes that you can gush over, in my opinion it's pretty hard to mess up the ground chickpeas in frying. two friends opted for the gyros and it looked good the meat was sliced ​​thin which is somewhat different from others I've had, they seemed to enjoy the meal but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed either. We actually didn't mention anything about food during the hour and a half trip home. The food is not bad at Pita Shack by any means. sandwich salad and drink service as previously stated is without a doubt the brightest part of the place as we finished our meal the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house, we declined after being quite full and satisfied with our respective sandwiches. I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him and he had positive comments about it now for me it's the food that really matters so I gave it three stars instead of the four I was about to give if I ever came back to the Tempe area in search of food. a pita, I would definitely give pita shack another chance, if only to support a really nice guys business",Good

I asked generally about the undiscounted prices of nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers going for five to seven dollars if I pay seven dollars for a pint at a sports bar. tempe it better be something from the russian river or a stone birthday beer and a nine dollar manhattan seems out of place, it's not Scottsdale or a hotel bar, well the good news the thirsty lion is quite charming inside lots of seating and dim lights, it's really not a bad place to relax and unwind. recommendation, I hope that over time the prices will come down a bit and more craft breweries will be represented, but aside from the beautiful interior and the spot on the happy hour menu, the thirsty lion just doesn't stand out enough to keep me away from the rocks or the taste of the peaks",Good

I could smell the fish was horribly missing when the hello tuna salad was presented to me by the waiter and I am shocked that the kitchen actually thought they were getting away with sending it out, the waiter disappeared from my table so quickly that I had to go chase him down to point out to him that the bad smell at my table was coming from the food and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say ok we all smelled it and there is definitely something wrong not going there, seriously, you had to pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell in ten seconds that that's not how raw fish should smell after all that, their solution was to come an appetizer not the salad and eventually gave me a new salad to take away that I decided not to eat just to be safe, look, I'm not afraid of eating week old leftovers or sushi at a dive club and I'm not really scared by the cleanliness of the restaurants but it could have been dangerous. I have absolutely warned all my coworkers and friends about this place and now I am warning all yaps, this could have been handled in a way that left me confident that this was just another new restaurant problem, but the horrible service made it clear that was not the case and I shudder to think to what new level they are going to sink.",Very bad

We of course enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but each is a bit high considering they are at other locations and the boa cafe down the block has unlimited mimosas for a fixed price with food.

2604,"your reviews are hilarious, who was he referring to? i was looking at mars and they were just ignoring me for a few minutes, i didn't want to interrupt the conversation so i waited eventually, i get asked if i need help, no, i was just admiring your huge body and wondering how long it would take me to look like that, idiot on my last visit, a customer said excuse me to the employees behind me in the aisle, i glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook his head as they all ignored him. mom can we help you, she asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say you're welcome, the customer leaves and they continue sarcastically at each other, that's why we're here, no, that's not what we're here for, we're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do, that's why when I walk past an employee who is working if they look at me they immediately look away and pretend to be absorbed in his work to avoid stopping to help him. save money but the attitude is over the top, there are a few employees who smile and seem friendly at least when I see them and I can report them if not for the events most often mentioned above, I stay out of wm as much as possible which is a lot, I have reduced my trips there significantly but more importantly I have cut out a huge portion of shopping at wm",Very bad

The Mondrian is one of the few hotels I suggest, not so much because of the red bar, but more because it is conveniently located within walking distance of so many other best bars downtown.",Good
6699,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was so horrified by my experience that I had to go for a bite to eat and a late night drink with a friend. They were quite busy so we sat at the bar as I frequent Moon often. I was happy to see that the bar was also busy. The bartender quickly came over and was visibly intoxicated as she couldn't even tell me the flavors of the vodka they had. the guests had the same look of horror on their faces, we decided to order food as she spilled my glass on us, we refilled it with something completely different and she could barely speak at this point, we saw management observing her behavior and doing nothing as she proceeded to take dirty glasses and fill them with beer. I was so appalled by this that we left before finishing our drinks or food. sad return because we would see the moon horrible times a week",Very bad

They had to wait for minutes in a booth before anyone recognized us.",Bad
5081,"First off, I admit I'm not a very unbiased reviewer here, I absolutely love a good bowl of ramen, although I haven't been to Japan, I've been lucky enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Lot Angels, Chicago and San Jose, while I think this is probably some of the best ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that doesn't really mean much, it was okay, not great. miso available in mitsuwa stores across the country drool the noodles were okay although I wish there was more the broth wasn't very hazy and lacked the depth that really makes the bowl of ramen the silver was really the weak point thin sliced pork with no real noticeable silver quality the vegetables that came with it were nice although I wouldn't say that's what I'm looking for in short I'm saying it's Americanized ramen and not the cheap junk from the packaging but suits an American palate better instead of leaning towards authenticity no fish cake or bamboo shoots no cloudy creamy broth no pork belly money the place looks great and the staff are great I wouldn't reject it but republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either",Good
309,"if i could give these stars i would but that's because i have been there and so i know how good famous waves can be, there are two that i know of and i have been to both, they are both good, we visited this one near chandler mall for lunch, we ordered off the lunch menu, my wife and i both had the brisket sandwich, i had the wilbur beans, she had fries, it was good, not great, but ok, the breast meat itself didn't seem smoked at all. and the taste when it was smoked and it just didn't have it honestly the meat seemed sort of begging if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked and the meat or sauce was excessively salty it wasn't a big deal or I would have returned it but it was noticeable. the corn syrup yuck other than that it's poison to your pancreas it's just not good that's not how it's done anyway the famous waves aren't really anything special the b is ok but not very authentic given the choice I would take it hands down but if you want some and you're far away this will do the job for sure see my review of tomstruly horrible and the beans and the fries are pretty good",Good
733,"bland, dull food that's not worth the price or the wait to get it, we had lunch at Nourrir a few months ago and although we weren't very impressed as they serve healthy food that is in line with our plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another chance and went for brunch a few weekends ago. tempting, I asked to replace the bagel with multigrain bread, since the bread used to be the best part of the lunch sandwich. The waiter informed me that they were out of bread. How does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches. Very poor planning by management and the only other item available was a wheat roll which I opted for. My husband ordered the vegetarian quiche which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onions, parmesan and a quinol crust afterwards. an incredibly long wait the restaurant was far from full our food finally arrived my egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast dish I have ever consumed the airfield egg looked appealing as it would be healthy and non-greasy which it was but I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning or flavor at all the sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I didn't consume it that a cube or two of the flavorless mushy pile that was on my plate as bad as my meal was my husband's vegetarian quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted. The quinol crust that we were looking forward to because we love quinol dishes was actually undercooked quinol mixed throughout the quiche with no visible crust, giving the whole thing a grainy texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish. the strange taste and offsetting texture of the quinol was more than I could handle even in the one bite I tasted. I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of quiche he made. We also each had two bloody brands during our stay and although each took an incredibly long time to get the first one was tasty and seemed to be very spicy as we requested, but the second was flavorless and tasted like diluted tomato juice while Nourish has a lovely patio and offers views of the lush foliage present throughout the resort, these are not enough to bring us back after we leave with our taste buds horrified by the flavors or lack of flavors in our brunch",Bad
5179,"anything with the original word in that name always makes me wonder if this place is real, it's very close to the new house and I met the renters there for a burger the other night and to watch the giants fight their ears, I immediately felt a sense of familiarity when I walked in the door, I didn't remember being there before until I walked in but it all came back to me very quickly. You can either go up and order then bring your food to your table or if you are on the bar side you can order from the bartender who is very attentive even with a full bar and restaurant once you get your burger or sandwich you go to the repair bar stock up on the toppings and vegetables then sit down to enjoy they also have good sides and like fried mushrooms, onion rings, zucchini and fries they are ok a little overcooked for my liking but all the rest was great, it's a great place to make a regular stop on your weekly happy hour schedule to watch a sports game, tons of TV at the bar or to satisfy your burger cravings",Good

Actually my husband usually relies on me to do this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the double ha beef to him but the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't ruin the great taste of that one, what I missed was the traditional ingredients like rare steak and tripe tendons, I know I know it sounds intense but trust me it makes it taste so good I guess I just have a usual when it is about that, so I was a little disappointed that I couldn't satisfy my craving to the highest degree, woe is me, but let me conclude by stating once again that the one here is really good and has an excellent broth flavor.

There's even a mom and dad place near my apartments that equals quality and taste. nachos, I'm not even kidding, four or more people could munch on this, they make it just the way I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños, sour cream and guacamole yum, that's what kept me coming back, but after the other night I feel like I'm sure to find a place whose nachos make me just as happy. we weren't even half finished with our nachos when he asked while I was eating, were you done with this not only asking but reaching out to grab the plate and this happened multiple times while we were trying to finish our food, I don't know if they wanted us to get out of there or what and then for someone who was so attentive I waited minutes for a drink refill, make the glasses clear and this didn't won't be that hard to tell if I need more, my friend and I left full but irritated if I thought the quality of service was a one time thing. I wouldn't even put this review up, but the fact is when you pay for overpriced Mexican food in North Scottsdale it's not like your options are slim, I recommend going next door to Arrobas, good food and great service.",Bad
961,"the food was good I had the chopped fruits de mare apparently the portion is large as the waiter suggested it may have been too big for me but the portion was typical of a fruits de mare type plate I have had in other restaurants the sauce was nicely spicy and good flavor the pasta was well cooked and the right portion size I think people add too much pasta to make the dish bigger other than the imitation crab a disappointment but not a deal breaker the seafood was well cooked between the calamari mussels and the kids spaghetti was very good i taste all the kids spaghetti since i had kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl the pasta was well cooked the meatball was ok but the sauce was sick and thick not watery which i hate and covered all the pasta which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to make the meals the butter used is very tasty some type of garlic I think the bread was warm, soft and not overcooked now I would have given stars with a few exceptions the decor and slower service the decor was terrible sorry old and dated I think their target demographics are years or older like the photos of the chairs and everything inside screams the chairs remind me of an old conference room the lighting is on the dark side I guess if I was on a date or with retired couples this would be a nicer decor but with adults and children it just doesn't suit quite right for children, not quite, but the children's welcome is more like it, as the mood is darker and the volume of conversations is softer. Having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them overall, the food is good, the servers are friendly but it's not the family friendly place I usually go for.",Good
9650,"I saw this company fixing it and thought I'd give it a try. I was tasked with replacing a daylight photo sensor for our front lights. Here are the troubleshooting service call diagnostic fees. Price without problem to replace the sensor on their simple price. They replaced the small recessed photo sensor with one that sticks out from the side of the house. This is clearly not the same room with I phoned Mr Sparky to register my complaint. results, I just believe if you pay for a small photo light sensor you should get a similar part in return, amazing to repair it, they definitely haven't done their research on this company",Bad

I guess it's a good place to hang out. They have a patio and a cozy interior like truck stop decor but bigger and not as cool. I thought the beer selection was lacking, the service was slow and obnoxious. Phoenix in Boston all the bartenders are annoyed to serve you so I'm used to it but this is Phoenix, damn one guy in particular was standing behind the bar with his arms crossed I'm not sure what his role was in the whole process of serving the bar he didn't even take a drink he just stood in contempt of the customers overall this place is decent but I wouldn't choose to go back.

1871,"I will say the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff we went to lunch and asked to sit on the patio, most of the people we are eating at, but then they sat a large group right next to us who only wanted to drink and smoke. I know smoking was allowed on the patio, but since it wasn't the only table available and we were eating food, I think they should have seated them a little further away from us. Our order was not good but we couldn't get the waiter to come back so we just gave it up, the food was excellent There were a few items on the small plates then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich both very good. My biggest complaint is that we are ignored unless we are actively looking for someone and then grab someone as they walk by. I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but the service needs to be beefed up for sure.",Good

End of discussion, there are the actual words coming out of her mouth, she looked really angry and also maybe terrified of me and my fury labs, luckily she handed me my water so I didn't have to stab her, which was good because I was too thirsty to stab anyone, I have to be well hydrated to commit crimes of passion and I'm crazy, crazy, passionate about my cupcakes, yo",Very bad

Ground Turkey Feta Salad is what I had today. I had them add asparagus which was a good choice if I do say so myself. often eats in sauce also he will have a salad or a sandwich the last time we were there together he had the salami turkey prosciutto mozzarella pain I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised there was a good balance of thin slices of meat cheese lettuce tomato and tangy red wine vinegar between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread the thin crust pizzas are pretty decent too depending on your appetite sharing a pizza and salad with your companion can turn out to be a satisfying meal what I like about sauce the quickest, friendly and efficient service in a clean and relaxed environment, moderate prices are also a big plus in my opinion, especially in this economy",Good

The purse and stitching are mustard yellow, it looks horrible. They tried putting cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement now, the thread just looked dirty. that's good, they wouldn't refund the amount I prepaid just in store or redo it with the correct color thread, they kept saying I fixed it, looks like I'm going to find a new shoe repair place",Very bad

I've been vaccinating between non-metro cities and here for about years and yes, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a solid basis of comparison, it's a joke compared to other cities in the US and abroad that have equivalent populations, New York and Los Angeles are so much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is ​​easily years behind every other comparable citywide transit system, with times when we need buses that run more than once an hour and it's currently the fastest buses that are on time every day, they are never on time, always way too early without a wait or way too late without excuses, more stops, stops that have actual benches, shade, or posted information of any kind. I can't even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with relevant information or signs. and and and but seriously, it's just horrible and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transportation anywhere else",Very bad

I fried the charcoal, the charcoal adds absolutely nothing to the burger overall, if I'm going to spend on a burger with no sides it better be perfect and it wasn't.

The chicken was excellent but the customer service was so bad we will never come back again. this place just because the chicken is good doesn't mean you treat people like shit, we had to remind the staff more than six times to get our order, we waited several minutes for the other pieces of chicken to finish our meal, we don't mind waiting, but it was pretty rude when you watch other people having their meal when they came in after us, the mac and cheese didn't look like everyone else's, it looked like it came out of a box, you can say it was far from homemade it was clear it was undercooked no crust the sauce was watered missing cornbread was overcooked and under salted the cornbread was definitely not like everyone else's felt like we were given leftovers seriously the worst service we have ever received the place needs to learn to be respectful and just plain nice",Very bad

The bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they had was freshly breaded and not frozen, which is why it takes longer. dead end your kitchen all that being said even after the wait if the food was good I would write a positive review right now the problem is the food was just so so the okra had no flavor and wasn't fully cooked to a nice crispy crust my catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick my wife's gumbo was a little bland almost like the roux was a little weak I really wanted to like this place after our first experience I probably won't go back",Bad

I think I would go a lot more because it has to be something I really want to see and after not being as impressed with the Chuck Jones stuff I'm a little wary there wasn't even a screen in the theater just a blank wall if they were showing new indie films and old films I think they would really have something cool to do I hope they can figure it out because I would really like to see the place become what it could be",Good

I too don't understand the point of photos of very long red nails holding bills. Super cheesy, this place doesn't disappoint with the decor, it's like visiting a spa rather than a nail salon. I didn't spend a lot of money if the product is good, but I had to go home and clean off the polish left trapped around my cuticles, file the hard edges of my nails down to something that wouldn't hurt my husband and the massage was like being tickled then rubbed with a stone. mine is filed in a different shape, now I have to do it all again myself, maybe it's because I didn't ask a specific person for the nails, maybe the reviews I read that are stars seem to refer to a specific person, maybe I'll try one more time and ask Kevin who seems to have good reviews if so, I'll post again hopefully with a better rating next time at the moment, this place is definitely not worth it no more than two stars and these stars are only for good location, reasonable prices and nice atmosphere, I give zero stars for the quality of nail polish and pedicure.",Bad

Finally, the dish could have satisfied with just a little more cheese. I was expecting a bit more with the price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced ​​pieces of eggplant on top of the salad, I don't know about you but when I order a salad I expect a salad, it was a salad but not with a lettuce or lettuce look. We ordered the cares di pomodoro. salad base, then have the tomatoes with cheese and basil, then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing, it was nothing more than what the description said, it was two tomatoes cut in half with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves, then the lemon jam mixed with olive oil on top, don't get me wrong, it's absolutely amazing and I would love to have it again, it's just not what I was expecting so it would have been nice to know exactly what I was ordering to make matters worse, our so called salad took about a few minutes to arrive. the table after ordering it took so long the chef actually apologized and told management he was going to send us some soup for the wait we were fine and we weren't in a rush but when we already had our food it was taking forever and told us we were going to have soup we were expecting it the soup never came after an hour and a half for our main course we got our food it was good but nothing to write home about on my polls, Portofino was bland to say the least and was actually a bit dry, the potatoes were ok but again a bit bland my date had the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa allarrabbiata the ravioli pasta was so thick you really couldn't taste the filling and the sauce was too sweet in my and my dates opinion, we did however order a side of the risotto parmigiano and it was simply incredible. this is the decision to go back to alto, it won't be at the top of my list because it's overpriced for what you get and overall just not the best first experience. I will however consider stopping for risotto or going for it when it comes to good Italian, I think I will stick to the grotto Italian or the pane e vino",Bad

1780,you want a hotel what really matters cleanliness stars friendly staff and they had some really good barrel candy I agree now that we've gotten that out of the way funky smells in one of the hallways and the elevator at one end of the hallway was broken our entire stay I would come back although the price is solid,Good
9591,not impressed start with the service not professional it seemed the waiters had no idea of ​​table numbers we were given the wrong table order twice a second the food was conceptually a mess no clear theme or flavor profiles the food was very greasy and took forever to arrive none of the dishes were memorable thirdly the wine selection seemed lacking and the sommelier didn't know where the wine she was serving came from not impressed,Bad
250,"ok so here's my two cents on the brat, I suggest avoiding the brats, I tried the Thai spicy brat beer, found them a bit dry and bland, also found the pretzels less than fabulous, I suggest trying big meatballs tasty and juicy, much better selection, very cool outdoor patio, cool open space with lots of seating and a big funky art wall, the service was also friendly and attentive and great fair prices overall, definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and in the mood for something different",Good
8866,"oh math so what retards they work here came to pay my phone bill and literally stood in line for horrendous minutes, they had two friends in the salesroom this afternoon and the store was absolutely packed, what a genius decided to schedule two fucking idiots who knew anything on a busy Saturday afternoon and no, I don't care about upgrading my phone, I just want to pay my bill and from there, do you really think that after such poor service, I will want to upgrade your commission rate by purchasing an upgrade of my phone with you no",Very bad
8814,"I decided to break the routine and get my hair cut at a great local clip. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced hair stylist who could do a flat top. The lady assured me that was the case. Gunny and a flock of seagulls, I went home, put the clippers on and finished the job. I wouldn't come back here unless I lost a bet.",Very bad
7161,"chain restaurant that is about okay for dining with friends if I didn't have beer at lunch I would probably suggest eating elsewhere the food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal I have eaten here about half a dozen times over the past few years while in town for business weekends it is located on the corner of the mill and fifth street in downtown Tempe among many other local restaurants during my last visit. again the beer was exceptional so I wasn't unhappy overall, I love burgers and think I will stick to this as my main choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any time when the service was particularly unsatisfactory and there were no times when the service really stood out as exceptional. but I can't always get it all down during a short lunch break. I'm a good place to eat if you're hungry and in the city center, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.",Good
6891,"the beer is good, most of the food is okay but I have a big problem with the bus, they advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish when you order one you will know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois the pizza is more like something I expected to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I had growing up in Chicago, have a beer here before seeing a movie next door, except it There are much better places to eat in and around the Chandler Fashion Center",Bad
7080,"we tried this last night, will not be returning, there is no indication when you walk in that it is a sit down restaurant, we stood like idiots in the hostess area until someone asked us if we needed anything, we sat down ourselves, then sat down and sat down as there was no assigned server, maybe that is a reason to seat customers so a server knows they finally arrived. The hostess asked us if anyone had helped us and she was very polite and took our order. the food, it would have been understandable if the place had been packed, but that might not have been the case, it might have been full on Saturday and there seemed to be a lot of waiters, there was a big party on the patio, I ordered the vegetarian salad, I can't remember the name of it, which advertised cicada beans with avocado and other delicious things. I emptied one and threw it on my salad it would have been more forgivable if they had forgotten it completely also the white beans were undercooked the pizzas were good I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese and it was loaded with summer squash roasted carrots local hmm olives leeks roasted onions and the crust was thin and crispy my husband also enjoyed his pizza I should actually give an extra half star to the hostess waitress who made my salad when I complained about it, I was ready to pay but she offered to take it off the bill the final nail in the coffin may not have been the restaurant's fault but the large party on the patio had elementary school age kids literally running laps around the restaurant for the first few minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hells ruin the experience for other diners, I fear it will be up to the restaurant to politely and discreetly ask the parents not to reign them in on such a chance anyway, this place has some things to work on, luckily for us there are too many other big businesses nearby. for us to give him a second chance",Bad
1924,"if you like terrible service and overpriced food you are in the right place if i knew before going there i would be paying for macaroni and cheese and have the pleasure of waiting an hour to get it while my glass remained empty i would have stayed away that's what you should do the food wasn't horrible although the group cut their mouths eating rock hard bread on their sandwiches the macaroni cheese was nothing special, service was more than mediocre the first and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Café",Very bad
5856,"let's talk about failure baby, hey, if your idea of ​​salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splattered with the most generic industrial dressing, you've found the right place to improve your tongue, go ahead, I ordered a check of capelin and replaced it with spaghetti. fresh tomatoes from Rome they had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass more than fresh produce the slightly pungent garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle not a light bulb and mother's respectable check should have more than a teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil this place makes the old spaghetti factory look like fine dining and I would rather starve than be even close to this chain restaurant from culinary hell this place is the brother disavowed junkie of it really is so terrible that I only gave them the one star because the management was incredibly charming and didn't charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food that was worth paying for",Very bad
5541,"I went here on vacation to visit my friend, neither of us had been there before but I know they have a lot of places on the west coast so we tried the staff was totally rude before we left, we called to check the hours the guy on the phone was condescending and acted embarrassed about having to give out information.",Very bad
9003,the food is ok sometimes good was excellent the service is terrible and a minute wait for lunch on Saturday seriously it seems the restaurant relies on a takeaway hostess ignored the people waiting to be on the waiting list irony intended to serve takeaway customers could tipping have any influence we were finally seated there was a pad thai with shrimp and chicken red curry the curry was very good but the shrimp was overcooked and the dish tasted noticeably different from the last visit the restaurant is incredibly loud to the point of being distracting we used to go there often but I will eat elsewhere from now on during Saturday shopping,Bad
1418,"so what kind of place serves chicken fingers and no ranch dressing the only sauces they had were honey mustard and secret cane sauce can I say new I thought the sauce tasted horrible I'm not too big a fan of honey mustard but I eat it sometimes if there's nothing else and it wasn't even good the coleslaw was horrible too I have to say the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland, they were the only dishes I tried, not that there were really any more items on the menu in Texas toast and fries, I think overall I will never go back",Very bad
1703,"I moved to Phoenix from Northern California where I had my Dutch brothers serviced almost every day, so I've either been spoiled by the excellent customer service in my area or the service here is truly terrible. I have been there several times and they have all been extremely superficial and inattentive, not to mention they all charged me different prices for the same drink, one person charges me and someone else charges me, pull yourself together and be a little more friendly and real with your customers.",Bad
7444,"this place is hit or miss, that's why I would rate it average. I've come here so many times for lunch because it's so close to work and because my coworkers suggested it. I have eaten all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even if I ask for one sometimes it is not spicy at all and sometimes it is so spicy that my mouth burns. overcooked I would stick to the different types of curries red green yellow although it would be safer the curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender the curries can also have different textures I have had it where it is thick and creamy as I like it or more diluted the lunch portions are quite small but I guess it is enough for a lunch meal beware of diapers if you are not too comfortable with spices, just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you, I always do I would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here, you might get lucky and have a nice meal",Good
2789,"oh at first you were intimidating, those crazy people coming out of your house shouting weirdly coming from the patio, not to mention your lack of leeway that causes your customers to watch each other drunk all night, but now I've learned to accept you, I don't like you yet, I'm still seeing other people, but I think we can have a future to love you in a few hours.",Good
2417,it's not a great place it's very upscale but the people behind the sushi bar don't really seem to know what they are doing it took forever to get a beer and sake here the worst was the yellowtail dashiki it looked like it was purple around the edges if you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll it will be Safeway quality but nothing too special this place is more about atmosphere and places to eat if you have a glittery Scottsdale shirt that you need to show off,Bad
2547,"like watching a train wreck in slow motion, I'll definitely go elsewhere for bagels from now on, disappointing, I've been going there for years, the eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch yuck",Very bad
6148,wow this place was terrible below I should have known since the place was empty on game night the food was greasy and flavorless everything on the plate was flat I said flat bland disappointing food save your money and eat at taco bell you will thank me later,Very bad
4606,"pretty tasty dogs, pretty long wait for a hot dog",Good
8560,not long ago I went to get takeaway and everything tasted like fish,Bad
9438,"my wife and I stopped by last weekend to watch football and try a few of their beers. The food was excellent, this might be one of the best fries I've ever had, the beer was good, I noticed almost everyone was drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro-brewery. There was a big crowd for the football lots of people wearing jerseys and everyone was really getting into their game. times since my first review and it's really just an average place the chips are the highlight the place is small noisy and well your average pub or brewery",Good
4421,"overpriced, overcrowded and every time I've been there I've confirmed they serve the worst martini, but if you're looking to people watch this is the place where the interior allows for a great open ambience with open space overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust system isn't strong enough for the bedpan tables because I smell like fried food when I leave.",Bad
