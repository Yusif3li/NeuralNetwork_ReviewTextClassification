Trial 1: Baseline CNN (The Control Group)

Architecture: 2 Convolutional Blocks (Filters: 128, 64) 
                Global Max Pooling 
                Dense Layer (64 units).

Parameters: 10 Epochs, Batch Size 32, Embedding Dim 100.

Results:
Training Accuracy: 95.88%
Validation Accuracy: 45.79%

Observations: The model exhibited severe overfitting.
              While the training loss dropped consistently to 0.10, the validation loss began to diverge and increase after Epoch 3.
              The model effectively memorized the training set but failed to generalize to unseen data.

Conclusion: The current architecture is too complex or lacks sufficient regularization for the dataset size.

Next Step: Introduce Early Stopping to halt training before divergence and increase Dropout to prevent memorization.

Trial 2: Early Stopping & Dropout (The Regularization Attempt)

Architecture: Same as Trial 1 (2 Conv Blocks), but with Dropout increased to 0.6.

Parameters: Early Stopping (Patience=3).

Results:
Training Accuracy: 72.34%
Validation Accuracy: 42.64%

Observations: Early stopping successfully prevented the massive overfitting seen in Trial 1.
              However, the model performance degraded compared to the baseline.
              The confusion matrix reveals a significant overlap between the "Excellent" and "Very Good" classes.

Conclusion: We successfully killed the overfitting, but the model is now struggling to learn useful features. 
            It is extracting noise rather than signal.

Next Step: Mere regularization isn't enough. We need to change the architecture to capture wider context (N-Grams) to distinguish between subtle sentiments.

Trial 5: Multi-Kernel CNN (The Breakthrough)

Architecture: Parallel Conv1D branches with kernel sizes [3, 4, 5], concatenated.
Parameters: 64 Filters per branch, L2 Regularization, Dropout 0.5.

Results:
Training Accuracy: 86.95%
Validation Accuracy: 52.36% 

Observations: The multi-kernel approach significantly outperformed the single-kernel CNN.
              By capturing variable-length n-grams (3, 4, and 5 words),
              the model improved its ability to distinguish between adjacent sentiment classes.

Conclusion: Context size matters. Pure CNNs can perform well if allowed to see wider context windows.

Next Step: We need to find a way to stabilize this high-accuracy architecture without losing its predictive power.

Trial 8: Small Model + Spatial Dropout (The Limit of Regularization)

Architecture: Small Parallel Conv1D branches (32 filters) -> GlobalMaxPooling -> Concatenate -> Dense (64 units).
Parameters: Embedding Dim reduced to 50, SpatialDropout1D (0.3), Increased L2 Regularization (0.02).

Results:
Training Accuracy: 61.43%
Validation Accuracy: 44.21%

Observations: This trial successfully eliminated the severe overfitting.
              The gap between training (61%) and validation (44%) dropped to ~17%, which is healthy.
              However, the aggressive reduction in parameters caused the model to underfit—it became too "weak" to capture the complex nuances of sentiment.

Conclusion: We have found the "floor" of our model's complexity.
            We successfully fixed the overfitting issue, but we cut too much "brain power."

Next Step: Explore external knowledge (Pre-trained Embeddings) to boost performance without adding architectural complexity.

Trial 11: Multi-Kernel + GloVe Embeddings (The Failed Hypothesis)

Architecture: Pre-trained GloVe Embedding Layer -> SpatialDropout1D -> Parallel Conv1D branches (Kernels 3, 4, 5) -> Global Max Pooling -> Concatenate -> Dense.
Parameters: Embedding Dim 100 (GloVe), 64 Filters, Spatial Dropout 0.3, L2 Regularization 0.001.

Results:
Training Accuracy: 81.63%
Validation Accuracy: 47.14%

Observations: The addition of pre-trained GloVe embeddings did not improve performance over the baseline.
              The model converged quickly but plateaued at a lower accuracy (47%) compared to the model that learned embeddings from scratch (Trial 5, 52%).

Conclusion: Simply adding external embeddings is not a magic bullet. 
            The external knowledge from GloVe appears to be less relevant than domain-specific features if not integrated correctly.

Next Step: Return to architectural improvements (Pooling strategies) before revisiting Embeddings.

Trial 15: The Merger (Dual Pooling + Label Smoothing)

Architecture: Parallel Conv1D -> Dual Pooling (Concatenate Max + Avg) -> Dense.
Parameters: SpatialDropout=0.2, L2=0.001, Pooling=Dual(Max+Avg), Smooth=0.1.

Results:
Training Accuracy: 59%
Validation Accuracy: 51.79%

Observations: This trial was a strong success, reaching 51.79% accuracy, nearly matching our best historical run.
              By combining Max Pooling (sharp features) and Average Pooling (smooth features), the model achieved high recall for "Excellent" (0.77) while maintaining respectable 	      recall for "Very Good" (0.40).

Conclusion: Dual Pooling is a highly effective strategy for this dataset, providing a richer feature representation than either pooling method alone.

Next Step: Combine the stability of Dual Pooling with a fixed version of the GloVe strategy to create a final, robust model.

Trial 20: The Final Synthesis (Frozen GloVe + Dual Augmentation)

Architecture: Parallel Conv1D (Kernels 3, 4, 5) -> Batch Norm -> Global Average Pooling -> Dense.
Parameters: Embeddings=GloVe (Frozen), Augmentation=NLTK + Back-Translation, Pooling=Avg.

Results:
Training Accuracy: ~57%
Validation Accuracy: ~54.1% (New Best Record)

Observations: This model achieved the highest validation accuracy (52.71%) of all trials.
              Most importantly, it is the most stable model. The gap between Training (~59%) and Validation (54.57%) is minimal, indicating zero overfitting.
              Merging NLTK augmentation with Back-Translation provided a diverse training set that prevented memorization.

Conclusion: We have finally surpassed the baseline. 
            The combination of Frozen Pre-trained Embeddings (for stability), Aggressive Augmentation (for variety), and Average Pooling (for generalization) is the winning 	  	    architecture.

Next Step: no next step , This is the final selected model for the project. (till now at least)
